 Discipline, self-control and proper dress code are essential for young women to protect themselves and avoid disturbances, harassment, and threats from external forces, said Mother Teresa Women’s University Vice-Chancellor G. Valli. Delivering the 24th Graduation Day address at the M.V.M. Government Arts College for Women here on Monday, she said that misuse or overuse of electronic gadgets and electronic media like mobile phone, computer and internet, and social media by women would invite trouble. Coping with threatsSeveral young women, who could not reveal or face such personal threats and harassment, took extreme steps like committing suicide. At the same time, use of these technology and gadgets for constructive activities would certainly help them progress in their career and life. “What the young women need now is self control and discipline while using these modern facilities,” she advised. The graduates and post graduates should not stop with their degrees. They should go for research. Their career growth should not restrict to their personal development but also for the society, she advised. Women had enormous potential than men. Youth were the country’s biggest wealth and strength. Even the U.S. was a bit apprehensive about India’s youth power. Streamlining this strong force would transform the country into a powerful nation soon, Ms. Valli said. She gave away degree certificates to 816 students, including 16 university rank holders.
