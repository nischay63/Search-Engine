 The rural police in Vadakara and Nadapuram have started fixing stickers in buses warning passengers against thieves.  The action comes in the wake of a spurt in theft cases involving migrant workers. There were seven such cases within a two-month period prompting the police to tighten their vigil. The police also asked the bus crew to be on the alert against persons who board the bus and create unwanted rush in groups. Most of the pick pocketing incidents take place when the travellers board the bus in haste unmindful of their money and ornaments.  In some of the buses, the bus operators themselves have come out with their own stickers advising the travellers to be cautious of pick pocketing attempts and robbery. Bus employees say they are finding it difficult to identity the fraudsters as large number of migrant workers are coming to the district these days and make use of the public and private transport services.  Police officials who are part of the Onam special checking drive say that they often travel by city bus to keep an eye on persons who create unwanted rush in buses and target the valuables of other travellers. “Bus operators have been asked to report such incidents to the nearby police station,” they add.
