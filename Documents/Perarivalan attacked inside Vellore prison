A.G. Perarivalan, a life convict in the Rajiv Gandhi assassination case, was reportedly assaulted by a fellow inmate inside the Vellore Central Prison for Men on Tuesday.A senior official of the Prisons Department said that Perarivalan (44) was attacked by Rajesh Khanna alias Raj Kumar (46), a life convict in a kidnap and murder case. Rajesh was lodged at the Vellore Central Prison in 2012.“Rajesh took a small rusted iron rod that was found in the sand and attacked Perarivalan at about 6.15 a.m.” he said.The official said Perarivalan sustained a “superficial injury” in the attack.“He has sustained a scalp injury, and was treated at the hospital inside the prison,” he added.Prison officials are inquiring to ascertain the cause of the attack, he said.“We are conducting inquiry on why the attack took place as the two prisoners are lodged in separate blocks. While Perarivalan is lodged in the high security-1 block, Rajesh is in the high security-2 block,” the official said. Perarivalan has been imprisoned in the case for the last 25 years.
