The Bakers’ Association Kerala (Bake) has asked the government to temporarily roll back the ban on plastic containers for read-to-eat food and drinks. The bakers raised the demand at an emergency meeting held here on Saturday. With Onam sales picking up, the decision would affect the functioning of bakeries, hotels and catering businesses. The government should call a meeting of all the stakeholders before making the decision known, said Bake president P.M. Sankaran.— Staff Reporter
