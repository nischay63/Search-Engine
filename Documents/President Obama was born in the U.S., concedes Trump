 Republican Donald Trump finally acknowledged on Friday that President Barack Obama was born in the United States but accused Hillary Clinton of starting the so-called birther controversy, a charge that independent fact-checking sites have said is false.“President Barack Obama was born in the United States. Period,” said Mr. Trump, reversing himself on a controversy about Mr. Obama’s birth that the Republican helped launch but that had become a distraction to his White House bid. “Now we all want to get back to making America strong and great again,” he said at an event at a new hotel he owns in downtown Washington.‘Hillary was to blame’Without offering evidence, Mr. Trump accused Democratic rival Clinton of starting the birther allegations during her 2008 presidential primary campaign.Mr. Trump had for years promoted the birther movement against Mr. Obama, who was born in Hawaii to an American mother and a Kenyan father. The birther conspiracies, which cast doubt over whether Mr. Obama is legally able to be President, incense black Americans whose votes Mr. Trump has been trying to court.Ms. Clinton demanded Mr. Trump apologise to the President for having helped spread the birther idea and said Trump had tried to “delegitimise our first black President”. “His campaign was founded on this outrageous lie. There is no erasing it in history,” Clinton said in an address to the Black Women's Association in Washington. — Reuters
