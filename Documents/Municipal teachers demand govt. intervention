 Members of the Municipal Teachers’ Federation of Andhra Pradesh called upon the State government to bring out necessary reforms in the municipal education for better performance of schools as well as teachers.In a release, federation State president S. Ramakrishna said all State governments in the country were recognising municipal teachers on a par with government school teachers.He said that the State government had been neglecting the municipal teachers without offering any transfers, promotions and other such provisions citing lack of service rules for municipal schools. He said that municipal schools were playing a key role in urban areas, helping the urban poor who are unable to afford corporate and private schools. Mr. Ramakrishna said that vacant posts in the municipal schools were not filled since long, and the working teachers are being burdened.Lack of equal treatment for municipal schools on a par with ZP schools has resulted in unicipal school performances lagging behind compared to other States thus giving way to corporate schools.Federation members demanded that the government consider reviewing the problems being faced by municipal schools, students and teachers and take necessary action.
