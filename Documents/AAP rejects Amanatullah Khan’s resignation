It is his family’s internal matter. The dispute is with his brother-in-law’s family. It is being said his brother-in-law had divorced his wife. Amantullah is not even communicating with them,” Mr. Sisodia said at a press conference. He claimed that the matter was being given a political colour. “He is being dragged into the matter because he has been unearthing Waqf land scams with honesty. Those who understand Waqf issues are aware how influential people have grabbed land. Amantullah is stopping these scams and hence is being targeted.”“I spoke to the Chief Minister (Arvind Kejriwal) and also other leaders, and we have decided to not accept his resignation,” Mr. Sisodia said.Statement recordedThe sister-in-law of Amanatullah Khan, who has accused him of sexual harassment, recorded her statement in Saket court on Sunday, the police said.The victim stood by the charges she has levelled against Khan in the statement recorded under Section 164 of the CrPC, a senior police officer said.
