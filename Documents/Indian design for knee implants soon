Cutting across hospitals, a team of knee specialists from private healthcare will collaborate with IITs and DRDO to determine the ideal India knee size.The exercise is warranted as implants imported and used in India are designed as per European and American patient specifications. Often, these implants do not prove a perfect fit and their shortcomings are exposed when Indians kneel to pray or perform some task which American or European patients usually do not perform.Six doctors who spoke at Arthroplasty Arthroscopy Summit 2016, hosted by Apollo Hospitals here on Sunday, said they would team up with the DRDO and IITs.The team will screen more than 1.5 lakh people over the next one year in a multi-centre trial to determine the Indian knee size specifications.“Our study will indicate if a knee size of North Indians is different from South Indians and such other variations. The currently available imported implants are in 5 to 6 sizes, often they fit on one side and not on the other for our patients. Through the study we will know the variation in knee sizes and intend to produce 30 to 35 sizes, which could fit for most Indians,” said Mithin Aachi Senior Ortho and Joint Replacement Surgeon at Apollo Hospitals.The doctors also expressed confidence in being able to lower the price of the implants through indigenous design and manufacturing.
