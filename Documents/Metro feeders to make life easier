The Kochi Metro Rail Limited (KMRL) has tentatively identified 40 routes for the metro feeder services connecting 19 stations in the 25.65-km Aluva-Pettah stretch.Though the routes (based on a study report) are far from being finalised, they are likely to form the basis for future discussions with all stakeholders including the Kerala Urban Road Transport Corporation (KURTC), private bus operators, and the Regional Transport Authority. In fact, the feeder service routes may be modified depending on the opening of other metro lines and feedback from the public.Of the 40 feeder service routes, 22 are circular, starting and ending at the same stations, and the remaining 18 are point-to-point routes between two metro stations or between metros stations and important points along the route. Together, they will cover 227.55 km, with circular services accounting for 116.05 km and point-to-point services covering 111.50 km, touching upon all major points along the route.Of the six feeder routes proposed from Aluva station, which is the starting point of the Kochi metro, three are circular, while the other three connect it with Desom Junction and Companypady and Kalamassery stations.One circular route each has been proposed for Pulinchodu, Companypady, Muttom, Changampuzha Park, Palarivattom, Lissie, and Vyttila stations, and three for Pettah.Of the three routes proposed for Kalamassery station, one is circular and the other two are point-to-point routes, connecting it with Cusat station and the Government Medical College.Three routes have been proposed from Cusat station – one circular and two to Pathadipalam station. Two routes have been proposed for Edappally station, while another connects it with Amritha Institute of Medical Sciences.Among the five feeder routes proposed from Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium station, two are circular each, and the third connects Infopark.
