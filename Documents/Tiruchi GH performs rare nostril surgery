Doctors at Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Government Hospital (MGMGH) attached to K.A.P. Viswanatham Government Medical College have performed a rare supernumerary nostril surgery on a 10-year-old girl.The girl, belonging to a village in Karur district, was born with an extra nostril, a congenital abnormality. As she grew up, this extra nostril also grew. The girl did not find difficulty in breathing and other normal nostril functions. But, there were instances when she was teased by school mates and villagers, forcing her parents, farm labourers, to seek a medical opinion.She was admitted to Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Government Hospital after being referred by Government Hospital in Karur a few weeks ago.After a few days of observation, a team of doctors from the Paediatric Surgery Department led by head D. Baskaran performed the three-hour surgery with a surgical and anaesthetic team. Mary Lilly, Dean, KAP Viswanatham Medical College, told The Hindu that it was the first such surgery performed in the hospital. Dr. Baskaran said that the functional outcome of the surgery was good and the cosmetic result also satisfactory. The shape of nose had also become normal. The surgery marks would slowly disappear, he said.
