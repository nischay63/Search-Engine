E-books, though evolving slowly, are more publisher and reader-friendly, says Ankit Pahwa, vendor manager (India) for e-book retailing and reading platform Rakuten Kobo.“It gives us the liberty to choose, topically, a single piece or a couple of pieces from an anthology and release it for the readers to relish. There are different tactics being tried out, including chapter-wise release of thrillers or multimedia-supported works while maintaining their value,” he says. The company currently deals in content in six Indian languages plus English and the response has been encouraging, he reveals.
