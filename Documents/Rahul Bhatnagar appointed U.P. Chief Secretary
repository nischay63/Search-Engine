He was earlier principal secretary (irrigation).He was picked for the post after his predecessor Alok Ranjan retired and was made chief advisor to the Chief Minister.With the 2017 Assembly elections approaching, Mr. Yadav on Monday sacked two colleagues — controversial Mining Minister Gayatri Prasad Prajapati and Panchayati Raj and Minor Irrigation Minister Raj Kishore Singh, whose name has also surfaced in the alleged scandal in construction of check-dams and cases of land grabbing.The decision came three days after the Allahabad High Court rejected the State government’s application against a CBI probe into allegations of illegal mining activity across the State.
