: Rejecting the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) offer to fully fund the Rs.6,728-crore Light Metro for Thiruvananthapuram and Kozhikode, the government has decided to go in for external funding for debt component of the MRTS project from the French Development Agency Agence Francaise de Developpement (AFD). The decision to opt for AFD, that is providing financial support for Kochi Metro, has been notified while giving the in-principle approval of the turn-key consultancy to the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation Limited (DMRC) and the nod for land acquisition for 33 light metro stations in two cities and three flyovers in the capital at a cost of Rs.272.84 crore.The September 8 Government Order issued by the Public Works Department (PWD), which is handling the MRTS project, based on the Cabinet decision says the AFD has been favoured “since the JICA loan is a tied fund.” Remission of tax by way of subordinate debt is an agreed condition while issuing administrative sanction for the project and similar benefit was extended to KMRL (Kochi Metro Rail Ltd) also, says the order issued by Additional Chief Secretary (Public Works) Subrata Biswas.Low interestPrincipal Adviser, DMRC, E. Sreedharan, who mooted the Light Metro, had promised a low-interest Special Terms for Economic Partnership (STEP) loan from JICA with an interest of 7.5 per cent. JICA, which had initially agreed to provide 85 per cent of the cost and to fund four flyovers on the Light Metro route in the capital, later offered to make available fund for the project excluding the cost of the land and taxes.A team led by the Deputy Director, South Asia Division-1, India and Bhutan, South Asia Department, JICA, Tokyo, Sunouchi Thesuhiko had even visited the capital in August last and had held talks with the Managing Director, Kerala Rapid Transit Corporation Ltd. The meeting was in continuation of the interaction Mr. Sreedharan had with the JICA authorities in New Delhi since May 19 last.The Finance Department had opposed the financing model mooted by the DMRC to approach JICA to fund the MRTS while the Cabinet took up the Detailed Project Report prepared by the DMRC for clearance during the UDF tenure. The department has also favoured the PPP mode for the project.The Finance Department had warned that agreeing to the procurement conditions for goods and services specified for JICA STEP loan would mean that the State would have to “purchase a sizeable portion of the equipment from Japanese firms.”
