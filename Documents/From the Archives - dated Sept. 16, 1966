Survey of student unrestA committee consisting of officials of the Central Bureau of Investigation and Inspectors-General of Police from different States has been set up to study the growing student indiscipline, it is learnt [New Delhi, September 15]. The committee, headed by the Director of C.B.I., Mr. D. P. Kohli, will suggest steps to tackle the problem. The survey will be made in the light of earlier studies on the subject by the C.B.I. These studies have attributed student indiscipline to “an immature and excitable frame of mind among the students, which neither the school nor the presence of law nor even the social environment has been able to control.” ‘Foreign aid to developing countries should be free from strings’Mr. Swaran Singh, External Affairs Minister, told the Commonwealth Prime Ministers’ Conference to-day [Sept. 15, London] during a debate on the world economic situation that extraneous political factors were being introduced more and more into the question of granting aid to developing nations.
