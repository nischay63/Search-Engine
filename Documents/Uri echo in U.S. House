 The outrage over the Uri terror attacks found an echo on the floor of the U.S House of Representatives on Thursday as Congressman George Holding raised it in the context of the growing concerns of terrorism worldwide. Mr. Holding, Republican from North Carolina, is also the co-chair of the India Caucus.Several members of the US Congress have issued statements in support of India after the Uri attack over the last week. The chair of the House subcommittee on terrorism has also introduced a bill that seeks to designate Pakistan a state sponsor of terrorism. “Across the world, terrorism is on the rise,” Mr. Holding said. “Just this past weekend, an Indian Army base near Pakistan was attacked by heavily armed militants who killed 18 soldiers” he said adding that the U.S. and India must work closer to combat terrorism. “Our two nations have worked closely to combat terrorism and more than ever, we must increase those counter-terrorism efforts with our partners in India and elsewhere.”The Congressman saidthe recent attacks in New York, New Jersey, and Minnesota all “underscore the increasing threat our nation faces from terrorism,” but the threat is not to U.S. alone. Calling for “strong leadership and unwavering resolve,” Mr. Holding said: “…that already this year, individuals have been arrested in thirteen different states for some connection to terrorism and there have already been over thirty ISIS-linked plots in the United States.”
