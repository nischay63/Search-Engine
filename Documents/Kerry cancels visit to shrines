Heavy rain leading to gridlocked streets forced US Secretary of State John Kerry to cancel his visit to Gaurishankar temple, Gurdwara Sisganj Sahib and the Jama Masjid.The Secretary of State was earlier scheduled to visit the religious shrines on Tuesday morning before holding talks with Indian officials but the trips were rescheduled for Wednesday morning.But the weather played spoilsport as he had to cancel the visit. The rain even delayed Mr Kerry’s speech at the IIT where he arrived almost an hour after the scheduled time.
