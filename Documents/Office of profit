The controversy over the “ >office of profit” issue will continue to drag on as long as the Supreme Court does not make clear which offices fall under the “office of profit” criteria. If it’s about parliamentary secretaries this time, it could be another post or office the next. In Ashok Kumar Bhattacharya vs Ajoy Biswas, the top court had ruled that to determine what constitutes “office of profit”, each case must be judged in light of the relevant provisions and sections. But this case-wise approach has several ambiguities. Perhaps the answer lies in following the England model — whenever a new office is created, the law lays down whether it is an office of profit or not.Karan Dange,New Delhi
