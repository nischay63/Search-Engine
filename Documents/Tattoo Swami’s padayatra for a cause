 He looks just like any other saffron-clad ‘sanyasi’, but for the strikingly-different images all over his body.Lakshmipathy Swami, who is better known as ‘Tattoo Swami’, hails from Udupi in Karnataka and is famous for his arduous treks to various pilgrim shrines across the country. Apart from universal objects like the Sun and the Moon, Lakshmipathy Swami got the images of Hindu deities such as Sri Venkateswara, Narasimha, Siva, Kali, Garuda, Hanuman, Ranganatha etc and saints like Madhwacharya and Vadiraja tattooed all over his body. There are 30 images on his body, including some on his forehead, temple and chest, which were done by a professional tattoo artist in Bengaluru. Feeling irritated at the sight of youngsters getting weird images of dragons, serpents and grotesque creatures tattooed on their body, the 63-year-old monk replicated the same concept with divine images. “The cost of tattooing them alone cost me Rs.1 lakh,” he told The Hindu while proceeding to Tirumala.His padayatra is meant to spread the message of peace, love and brotherhood enshrined in Sanatana Dharma. In the first leg of his trek that started in April from Udupi, he reached Tirupati after covering Mantralayam, Srisailam, Mahanandi and Ahobilam. From here, he visited Mangalagiri, Amaravati, Vijayawada, Draksharamam, Annavaram, Simhachalam, Arasavilli and Srikoormam and again reached Tirupati early this week. He walks around 30 km a day.
