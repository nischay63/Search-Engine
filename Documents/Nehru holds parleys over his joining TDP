Senior Congress leader Devineni Rajasekhar (Nehru) weighed the pros and cons of his joining the ruling Telugu Desam Party (TDP) in yet another meeting with his followers here on Sunday.His confabulations came amidst intense speculation that he has already prepared the ground to switch his loyalty to the TDP and that his re-entry did not meet with any stiff resistance. However, he did not take a final decision in the absence of a clear signal from the TDP.Speaking to The Hindu , Mr. Rajasekhar’s son Avinash said a meeting was held at their residence with the well-wishers but no final decision was taken.“We will let our stand known at the appropriate time,” he quipped even as rumours floated that only a formal approval was awaited before Mr. Rajasekhar crossed over from the Congress to the TDP.It may be noted that the TDP had held a discussion earlier on Mr. Rajasekhar’s coming back and there was no disagreement about it. He was one of the first batch MLAs of the TDP who won from Kankipadu constituency in the 1983 elections.Mr. Rajasekhar had joined the Congress in 1997 after the TDP was jolted by the power struggle within its higher echelons.Intense speculation about his switching loyalties and hisre-entry did not meet with any resistance
