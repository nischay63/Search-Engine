The first budget of the Congress government headed by V. Narayanasamy will be presented on Monday. The Chief Minister, who also holds the finance portfolio, will present a full budget after a gap of five years, at 9. 30 a.m.The previous All India NR Congress government had presented interim budgets, inviting criticism from opposition parties. It was because the plan size could not be finalised owing to the Model Code of Conduct that was in force during the 2011 and 2016 Assembly elections and 2014 Lok Sabha elections. In 2012 and 2013, a full budget could not be presented as the government failed to hold a meeting with the Planning Commission. Coming ahead of a crucial by-election to seal a berth in the House for Mr. Narayanasamy, political observers here vouch for a “please all” budget with specific steps to revive the automobile industry and farm sector. Mr. Narayanasamy on Saturday night chaired a marathon meeting with his Cabinet colleagues and officials to give final touches to the annual financial statement. It is expected that the Chief Minister would highlight various sops and incentives as he had been pitching for return of industries and to retain the existing industrial units.
