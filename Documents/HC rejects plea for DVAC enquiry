Nagamuthu and M.V. Muralidaran dismissed the petition pending since 2011 on the ground that the petitioner A. Jeyaprakash Narayanasamy had not included EMRI as one of the respondents to the case despite accusing the firm of having made sure that the conditions for granting the permission were tailor made to suit its abilities.
