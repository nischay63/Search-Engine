 The Tamil Nadu Farmers’ Association (non-partisan) has urged the Central Government to bring about changes in the crop insurance scheme. The Association’s leaders, who addressed reporters here on Saturday, said that nationalised banks while disbursing crop loans took away the premium at five per cent of the loan amount. The Government too contributed towards farmers’ loan but at the time of submitting claims, the insurance companies said that only if crop in the entire village/firka was damaged would they compensate the loss.This was a unique business model where at the time of providing the insurance cover, it was for a farmer but when it came to compensation for loss, it was collective loss. The Government must bring about a change and also let farmers decide if they wanted insurance cover or not.The Association wanted the State Government to act against errant officers and said in a recent case, officials in the Horticulture Department were caught while trying to cheat a farmer. The Association had lodged a complaint in this regard with the senior officials concerned.They condemned the Horticulture Department for delayed disbursement of seed. The Department ought to have given the seeds in June-July but disbursed those only much later, preventing the farmers from sowing in the right season. They sought compensation and reimbursement of the money spent on seeds.The farmers’ leaders urged the Government to have a relook at the eligibility criteria for the drip irrigation scheme saying that if the officials were not finding enough small and medium farmers, they should be allowed to include other farmers in the scheme.
