With the open gym established a year ago at Dr. Natesan Park on Venkat Narayana Road in T. Nagar registering impressive footfall, two more equipment have been added to the facility.S. Jayashree, a regular visitor to the park, says “The facility is considerably useful, especially the equipment that enables one to perform the air-walking exercise. It would be good if one more facility were provided.” The park was renovated last year and following this exercise, hand railings were erected. A footpath was laid with stone benches. A tennis court was converted into a children’s play area. A pebble pathway was laid. Another important facility that came up after the renovation is a circular platform. This has been constructed on a space free of trees and plants to enable sunlight to fall on it. The space, located next to an indoor gym, was set aside for yoga it has now received a roof. R. S.
