Similar collection drives for bottles and electronic waste will be held in September.As part of the next step in the Corporation’s ban on plastic carry bags, holograms for such bags will be made compulsory from September 1. The civic body had in July banned the sale of plastic carry bags below 50 microns.The minimum rate of the plastic carry bag with hologram has been fixed as Rs.9 for bags between 51 and 60 microns.For carry bags above 60 microns, the minimum rate has been fixed at Rs.10. Shopkeepers have been directed not to give carry bags for free. The Corporation has proposed that the cost of the bag be included in the purchase bill. There has been some apprehension among traders’ bodies over the hologram proposal and over the high cost of the plastic carry bags, which they believe will stop consumers from buying these bags.The Corporation had conducted a few rounds of talks with the traders’ bodies to convince them of the need for such harsh measures. The civic body has also banned the use of non-woven polypropylene bags as these cannot be recycled. The use of plastic sheets and covers for wrapping food items has also been banned.
