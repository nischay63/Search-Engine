 On Wednesday, the action in the Samajwadi Party (SP) feud shifted to the national capital with an angry Shivpal Yadav flying in to confabulate with party patriarch Mulayam Singh. After a meeting that lasted over three hours at Mr. Mulayam Singh Yadav’s Ashoka Road residence, Mr. Shivpal emerged beaming.Later, at a hastily convened press conference at the U.P. Sadan, he said, “I am still in government.. I will do whatever Netaji (Mulayam Singh) asks me to do.” Asked about his key portfolios being taken away, he smiled: “Well, I am now State chief..my only goal is that we should win the elections in 2017.” Pressed further on a diminished role in the Union Cabinet, a still conciliatory Shivpal Yadav said, “Mulayam Singh is the mukhia (leader); Akhikesh is the CM.”Programmes cancelledMeanwhile, in Lucknow, U.P. Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav, “cancelled” all official programmes for the day including one event at the Hindi Sansthan and another at his official residence. He explained the controversy as “a tussle in the government, not the family,” adding that he had taken “only some” of the decisions while most had been taken after consulting the party supremo. “If I have taken any decision, it was in consultation with ‘netaji’ but at times one has to apply his own mind and I too took some decisions on my own,” he said.Earlier in the day, Mr. Shivpal Yadav met supporters at his residence in Saifai.
