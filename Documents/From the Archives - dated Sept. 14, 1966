No take-over of banksIn its election manifesto issued to-day [September 13, New Delhi] the Indian National Congress, has sought the mandate of the nation “to work for a social order based on freedom and justice which will ensure that every individual has the means and opportunities for a full life and is enabled to make his maximum contribution to the service of the nation.” The 4,000-word manifesto says, “In an economically underdeveloped society like ours, the very structure of political power and its interlinking with command over economic resources make it necessary that the commanding heights of economy shall not be in private hands, for they who hold the levers of economic power will also ultimately run the political apparatus. A subject which raised some controversy in the Congress Working Committee is nationalisation of banks. There is no specific demand for nationalisation of banks in the manifesto. The compromise formula evolved is that banking institutions should be brought under social control in order to serve the cause of economic growth more effectively and make credit available to the producer in all fields where it is needed. This is in fact the policy that is now being pursued by the Government and the banking operations are controlled to a considerable extent. The manifesto urges the imposition of limitations on urban income and profit “which is more or less a reiteration of the decision taken at the Bhubaneswar Congress years ago.” In particular the manifesto wants “concrete steps taken for placing restrictions of individual holdings of urban land for preventing racketeering in land in urban areas and making available housing sites to the lower middle and working classes at reasonable prices. For the first time perhaps there is no reference to “mixed economy” in the manifesto. The importance of the public sector has been emphasised in the manifesto and then attention is devoted to the co-operative movement and the need for spreading the movement in the agricultural and industrial fields. But the Congress Party took credit for the increased production of cement, cotton textiles, petroleum products and also steel which fall almost entirely in the private sector.Gordon cuts short space walkCommander Richard Gordon, who stepped out of Gemini 11 into space to-day [Sept. 13] for what was to have been a 115-minute experimentation session, was ordered to get back into the capsule 40 minutes later after he had repeatedly complained of tiredness and heat. The space walker was out of breath. He was sweating heavily. Drops of sweat were blocking vision. It was the third straight time that an American astronaut cut short a space stroll because of troubles. Command Pilot Charles Conrad Jr. flashed the word to a tracking station in the Indian Ocean that Gordon was back inside the space-craft and that the cabin was re-pressurised. Gordon had trouble organising his 30-foot tether after opening the hatch and it apparently put a heavy work loan on him. Conrad had to hold on to the space-walker’s legs to prevent him from floating out before he was ready. “I’m breathing hard... I’m pooped,” Gordon reported. Once outside, Gordon moved over to an Agena satellite attached to the nose of Gemini-11. The astronauts had caught and docked with the Agena in record time after their launching yesterday from Cape Kennedy. “Ride it cowboy”, Conrad told him, and then reported to the ground, “He’s riding it like a cowboy”.Broadcasting project being revisedA rural broadcasting project to educate about five million illiterate farmers drawn up by a joint FAO-UNESCO team of experts is being revised by the Government on the advice of the Planning Commission. The Education Ministry in March this year had sought the assistance of the joint team to help India formulate the project to submit to the U.N. Special Fund for assistance. Accordingly, the joint team recently submitted a report outlining a project costing about Rs. 33 crores. The main object of the project was to integrate the functional literacy programme with the high-yielding variety agricultural programme in the 16 principal States spread over 130 districts. The UNESCO-FAO project was to cover 32-5 million acres of land and 5.28 million illiterate adults representing about one-third of the total illiterate adults in the area. The Ministry of Information and Broadcasting had a major role in the project. It was to arrange radio farm forums for the farmers. The Planning Commission’s advice for a revision of the project is understood to have been based on both technical and financial grounds.
