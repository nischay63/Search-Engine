: Members of the BC Janasabha on Wednesday staged a dharna at Dr. NTR University of Heath Sciences (Dr. NTRUHS) seeking cancellation of the first counselling and demanded fresh counselling that would include the over 900 seats sanctioned by the Medical Council of India.Speaking to media persons, State secretary G. Gangadhar said that recently-held counselling lacked transparency and it affected both reservation and poor meritorious students belonging to upper castes.“Though the last date for counselling is September 30, the university authorities are doing it (counselling) in a hurry. It appears that the counselling is helping the private medical colleges make money,” he said. He said by conducting fresh counselling by adding the 900 seats, there was a possibility for those who got admission in the reservation category to get a seat in the open category now. “Those vacant seats can be filled by other eligible BC candidates,” he pointed out. He demanded that counselling be conducted after it is held in Telangana, which is in the third week of the September.He said Padmavathi Medical College conducted counselling all by itself and they did not follow the rules and regulations.
