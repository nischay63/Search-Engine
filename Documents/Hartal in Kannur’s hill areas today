The government order to stop the works on the hill highway passing through the eastern hill areas of the district has spawned furious exchanges among political leaders. The local action committee has called for a dawn-to-dusk hartal on August 29 with the backing of the Congress and local MLA K.C. Joseph in protest.The Congress-led United Democratic Front has attacked the Left Democratic Front (LDF) government, saying that the decision to stop the works would adversely affect road connectivity in the hilly areas.Sudhakaran’s versionPublic Works Minister G. Sudhakaran countered the agitation, terming it politically motivated. The UDF government had announced 14 projects for 14 districts under the District Flagship Infrastructure Project (DFIP), at Rs.1,400 crore, the Minister said. The number of projects was later increased to 21 and in-principle sanction was given for the projects, estimated to cost Rs.3,771.47 crore, without adequate funds.Discussions were going on with Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan and Finance Minister T.M. Thomas Isaac on raising funds, he said.Former Minister K.C. Joseph, who represents the Irikkur constituency comprising the hill areas of the district, said that as long the government order was in force, the highway works remain stopped.It was one of the 10 projects launched by the previous UDF government under a 15-year annuity scheme involving allocation of funds from the petrol/diesel cess, he said.Fund shortage for the project resulted when it was shifted from the annuity scheme to the special development fund. The MLA also said that the fact that 20 per cent of works were completed showed that the works were progressing quickly.
