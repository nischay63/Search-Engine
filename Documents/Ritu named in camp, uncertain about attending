 Former Indian women’s hockey captain Ritu Rani, who was dropped from the team for the Rio Olympics citing “attitude” issues, has been named among the 29 probables for the National camp beginning on Sunday in Bhopal. The 24-year-old Ritu led the Indian women to their first Olympic appearance in 36 years but had fallen out of favour with the team management after reportedly “not being focused enough”She had also got engaged during that time. Having led the side for almost a decade, the talented midfielder had been left out of the Rio-bound side barely a month before the Games. In her absence, Sushila Chanu was named skipper. Ritu, however, is yet to decide on joining the camp or her future with the National side.
