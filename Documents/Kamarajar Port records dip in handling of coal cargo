Going by the phrase that one person’s gain could be another’s loss, the well-planned coal supply management executed by the Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation (TANGEDCO) has resulted in a dip in coal handling at Kamarajar Port in Ennore and other ports.Kamarajar Port in Ennore has reported a 15 per cent drop in cargo volume till August 20 compared to the same period a year ago as power producers have slashed their coal imports.However, a senior official of the port said this was only a temporary phenomenon with the port recording a minimal slump in cargo volume for July 2016.The official said coal imports by TANGEDCO had come down this year through better inventory management and by giving priority to power generated by wind mills.Chettinad Coal Terminal, which handles coal for private players, has assured that the import would increase in a month as four vessels are expected to call soon.Last year, the Kamarajar Port handled 30 million tonnes, of which TANGEDCO and NTECL accounted for 18 million tonnes.A senior official of TANGEDCO said the coal department put in a scientific practice of rationing the imported coal supply to the thermal power stations by reducing the stock supply from 20-25 days to 10-15 days, faster transportation of coal to the destination and rescheduling vessels bringing coal material.By rationing the imported coal supply, the usage of imported coal was reduced by 22 to 24 per cent in the financial year 2015-16.Crores savedThe supply of imported coal for thermal plants in the State was reduced to 5.44 million tonnes from 7.81 million tonnes.The decrease in the purchase of imported coal by 24 lakh tonnes has resulted in a saving of Rs. 1,179 crore.Similarly, savings made by meticulous planning of chartering the vessels, transporting of more coal by rail and withdrawal of port congestion charges at Kamarajar Port, have all resulted in a saving of Rs. 1,300 crore.
