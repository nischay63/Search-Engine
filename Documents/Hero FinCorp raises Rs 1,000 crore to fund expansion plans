But not now.”Hero FinCorp is looking to cater to the increasing demand from rural India, the company’s CEO said, which is being boosted by government initiatives like the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana and the distribution of Aadhaar cards.“Rural areas are more underpenetrated and penetration is increasing there also because of the Jan Dhan Yojana and Aadhaar cards,” Abhimanyu Munjal said. “Demand will come from here.”The company will use the Rs 1,000 crore to improve its technology and for the expansion of its asset size and product portfolio, he added.
