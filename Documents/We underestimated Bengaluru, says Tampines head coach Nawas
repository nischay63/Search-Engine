 Albert Roca was pleased with Bengaluru FC’s 1-0 win over Tampines Rovers in the first leg of their AFC Cup quarterfinal tie, but felt the margin of victory might have been greater. “The result could have been better,” the BFC head coach said later. “We had chances in the second half. But some of our players were tired, which is understandable. “We’re a team in construction and we will improve from here. We know we can beat them. The job is far from done, but we have to go to there [Singapore] without fear.” The game was played to empty stands, with the Sree Kanteerava Stadium closed to the public after the violence in Bengaluru’s streets earlier this week. “Conditions were a little strange,” Roca admitted. “There were no fans. But we hope to give them another chance to see us in the AFC Cup — in the semifinals.” The Tampines head coach, meanwhile, was scathing in his assessment of his side’s performance. “Maybe we underestimated Bengaluru,” Akbar Nawas said. “We were not good enough. We started too slow. We are fortunate the tie is still only 1-0. We will definitely make changes for the return leg. We have to start brightly.”
