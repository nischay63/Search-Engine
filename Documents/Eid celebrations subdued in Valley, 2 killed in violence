Curfew and widespread clashes that left two youths dead on Tuesday dampened Eid festivities in the Kashmir Valley, which has been witnessing protests for the last 65 days claiming the lives of 78 people.While curfew was imposed in all 10 districts of the Valley, 55 incidents of clashes were reported between angry mobs and security forces, in which several protesters and police personnel were injured.For the first time in nearly two centuries, no Eid prayers were offered at the historic Jama Masjid. The grand mosque was last closed in 1821. No Eid prayers were offered at the Idgah also while the authorities allowed partial use of the Hazratbal Shrine for prayers.Soon after Eid prayers ended in Bandipora, a group of protesters started hurling stones at security forces, who fired tear smoke shells."The police used some tear gas in which one person, Murtaza Ahmad, of Dachigam, Bandipora got injured. He was shifted to hospital, where he succumbed to his injuries," a police spokesman said.
