A specially-constituted five-judge Bench of the Madras High Court has recommended that the State government repeal the Tamil Nadu Borstal School Act, 1925, since it had outlived its purpose.The Bench comprising Justices A. Selvam, M. Sathyanarayanan, B. Rajendran, R. Mala and P.N. Prakash quashed a 2008 Government Order (GO), declaring all the sub-jails in the State as borstal schools.The GO was passed in reaction to a Division Bench’s omnibus direction asking all magistrates in Tamil Nadu to send all undertrial prisoners in the age group of 18 to 21 to borstal schools while the fact is that there is only one borstal school in the State in Pudukottai.The Special Bench was constituted to decide on six queries. The questions included: whether under the provisions of the Act, a trial court could exercise its discretion and detain an adolescent offender (Between 16 and 21 years of age) either in prison or in a borstal school after ascertaining the chances for reformation. Another query placed before it was whether young offenders sentenced to undergo life term, are entitled to be detained in borstal schools.‘Adolescent offenders sentenced to undergo life term were not entitled to be detained in borstal schools’
