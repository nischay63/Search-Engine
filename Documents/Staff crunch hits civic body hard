The Kozhikode Municipal Corporation has been hit hard by a severe shortage of contingency workers, especially the wards that were added to the corporation in 2010 following delimitation.Puthiyappa councillor K. Nisha had raised the issue during the council meeting last week. According to her, six wards of the corporation that were part of the erstwhile Elathur grama panchayat are facing severe shortage of staff. “For all the six wards, there are only four contingency workers. As a result, the main streets are not swept on most of the days. If a worker goes on leave, the situation turns worse,” she said, adding that the situation was no different in the wards that were part of Beypore and Cheruvannur-Nallalam panchayats.Chairman of the health standing committee of the corporation K.V. Baburaj said the civic body had a shortage of 224 contingency workers. Moreover, there has been no fresh appointment of contingency workers since the delimitation in 2010. “The corporation cannot make direct appointment of staff, as it comes under the purview of the State government. However, the corporation has sent a request to the employment exchange seeking appointment of 200 workers immediately,” he added.Meanwhile, the corporation, keeping its word to Kudumbasree workers who have been handling waste management, has requested the government to appoint Kudumbasree members as contingency workers. “Most of them will lose jobs once the new solid waste management project of the corporation takes off. Some of them could be absorbed into the project, but most of them cannot be,” Mr. Baburaj said.
