HYDERABAD: Veena and Vani, the co-joined twins, are being confined at Niloufer Hospital and should be allowed a normal childhood, a city-based NGO contends.Activists of Helping Hand Foundation held a protest outside the hospital on Friday holding placards that called for ‘freeing’ the co-joined twins. Veena and Vani have remained in the hospital for a decade since 2006 when they were first brought for separation. However, despite numerous evaluations, the twins remained joined as their separation has been deemed risky.Recently, the hospital administration sought to move the twins to a state home as they turned 13. The hospital claims it does not house patients older than 12. HHF has moved court demanding relief for the children and constitution of a medical board to decide for the children.
