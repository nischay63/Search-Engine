BJP MLA (Rajahmundry City) Akula Satyanarayana said his party was prepared for a debate with Jana Sena president Pawan Kalyan on whether the Special Category Status (SCS) is good for the State or the financial package announced by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley.Addressing mediapersons here on Monday, Mr. Satyanarayana said the BJP respected Mr. Pawan as a nationalist leader, and his genuine concern for welfare of the messages. But his stand on SCS differed from what he articulated at his Tirupati meeting and his statements at Kakinada a few days later.“Mr. Pawan should have properly understood what was given for AP before making his comments on BJP leaders. He should remember that he had the privilege of being taken to the Central hall of Parliament by none other than Prime Minister Narendra Modi, though he was not an elected representative of the people,” Mr. Satyanarayana observed.The MLA said Andhra Pradesh was the only State to have a commitment from the Union government to bridge its revenue deficit for five years. It was also due to the BJP’s Central leadership that the State had the luxury to borrow beyond the 3.5 per cent (of GSDP) without being constrained by the FRBM (fiscal responsibility and budget management) norms.The BJP was gearing up to thwart the false campaign that industrial development of the State was not possible without SCS.“The party will do its best for Andhra Pradesh, and those believing that SCS was the panacea for all the ills plaguing the State would be fooling themselves,” Mr. Satyanarayana added.
