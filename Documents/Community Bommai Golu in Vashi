Navi Mumbai: The women’s wing of Vashi Fine Arts Society (VFAS) will organise a community Bommai Golu from October 4-6 at Navi Mumbai Kannada Sangha Hall in Vashi.The Bommai Golu is celebrated during Navratri. The festival falls during the Purattaasi month, and on the night of the new moon, or Amavasya -- which is also the last day of the Pitru Paksha -- members of the family make sloping shift padi  (steps) in odd numbers and decorate them with mythological dolls made of clay or wood. It is an integral part of the Navratri celebrations in the southern states such as Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu. “The bommai  or dolls are handed down through generations, who over the years, keep adding additional dolls. We have been organising a community Bommai Golu for the past 18 years,” said Mohana Iyer, the head of the women’s wing of the society.The society has many dolls and every year, visitors donate new dolls that they add to their collection. This year, it will be a nine-step bommai collection and each step will consist of 12 dolls, small and big.To celebrate Navratri, the women wing will organise Lalitha sahasranamam parayanam, haldi-kumkum and bhajans every day, from 11 a.m. to 12 noon. In the evening, devotees will present devotional songs and cultural programmes, Ms. Iyer said.The writer is a freelance journalist
