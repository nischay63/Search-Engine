 The Andhra Pradesh Government has mooted having a separate regulating and accreditation mechanism to benchmark private educational institutions as it considers the existing body to be ‘over burdened’ and also because the “standards are based on lowest common factor”. An expert committee constituted by the Government to look into private universities entry into the State at its third meeting held here on Monday has also called for the exclusive mechanism to be in place by January 1, 2017. The panel also discussed the proposals from 10 more private universities which have come forward to set up campuses there in two phases.Initially, proposals of the sponsoring bodies of the World Peace University (MIT), Vel Tech, Karunya and Saveetha have been discussed and in the next phase the proposals of Amritha, Mahatma Gandhi University, Y.V.R., Seer Academy, Great Lakes International Institute and Vedic University are to be considered. Last month, letters of intent (LoIs) have already been issued to four universities — Amity University, SRM University, VIT University and Centurion University — based on the recommendations of the expert committee consisting of Pramath Raj Sinha of ISB, Anand Sudarshan, founder-director of Sylvant Advisors, Palle Rama Rao, former secretary Department of Science & Technology, Swati Piramal, vice-chairperson Piramal Enterprises, and Vice Chancellor of Sri Venkateswara University Avula Damodaram.Cumulatively, it is expected that up to Rs.5000 crore would be invested through these universities. Higher Education Secretary Sumita Dawra, who participated in the meeting, said a project monitoring unit to be headed former IAS officer Balasubramanyam would be constituted and it would look into the applications, track progress and coordinate with the expert committee. All these issues are to be placed before Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu for clearance, she said.“AP has created a legal and institutional framework to proactively facilitate private investments — through the AP Private Universities (Establishment and Regulation Act 2016. Our next target is to address the top domestic and foreign universities and firms with high corporate social responsibility funding who wish to become part of the CM’s vision to deliver quality growth and development of people,” she explained.
