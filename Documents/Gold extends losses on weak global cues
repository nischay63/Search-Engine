Falling for a fourth straight day, gold prices cracked below the Rs. 31,000-mark by losing another Rs. 100 to Rs. 30,950 per 10 grams on Thursday, picking weak overseas cues amid muted demand from jewellers in the domestic spot market.Silver, however, traded higher by Rs. 100 to Rs. 44,900 per kg on scattered enquiries from consuming industries.
