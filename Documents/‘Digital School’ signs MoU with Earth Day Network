Its ‘Say No To Plastic Bags’ campaign aims to reduce the number of plastic bags used in India and to suggest alternatives to these such as paper and cloth bags. Its ‘Low Carbon Lifestyles’ campaign aims to make people aware of the need to lead low carbon lifestyle by the judicious use of energy and by opting for renewable energies.During the campaigns, the students would be invited to participate in interesting activities that would help build awareness about the importance of saying no to plastic bags and to expanding awareness about low carbon lifestyles.
