The Union Ministry of Environment and Forest has rapped the Telangana government for its casual approach towards preparation of environment impact assessment (EIA) report while deferring forest clearance for the 4,000-MW Yadadri thermal power plant at Veerlapalem in Nalgonda district. The Expert Appraisal Committee on EIA of the Ministry, which met last month, highlighted plagiarism and copy-paste of information furnished to it about EIA. It was done without application of mind and consideration of site-specific factors for crucial aspects such as risk assessment and disaster management. After deferring clearance, it asked the Project Proponent (PP)to revise the EIA. The committee noted in its minutes that were put on the website of the MoEF, that the EIA submitted neither specified project details nor crucial details and data regarding water withdrawal and availability.Lack of details The report as well as subsequent responses by PP indicated substantial confusion and lack of details regarding coal unloading and transportation.
