 In a jolt to the Trinamool Congress (TMC), four party MLAs joined the ruling Congress in Manipur on Sunday. The TMC, which won 6 seats in the 60-member House in the last elections, has no elected representative now. Two other MLAs have already been disqualified by Speaker T. Lokeswor.‘Neglect of State’TMC State president T. Shyamkumar led the three MLAs joining the Congress. “National leaders of the TMC have been neglecting Manipur. They refused to take up the burning issues of Manipur in Parliament. The Inner Line Permit has been simmering for long and yet the TMC MPs declined to raise it,” Mr. Shyamkumar alleged. Another TMC MLA I. Ibohanbi said the Union government had refused to disclose the details of the framework agreement concluded with the NSCN (IM). Last week, former Minister and sitting Congress MLA Y. Erabot resigned and joined the BJP.
