Functioning of government offices, educational institutions and business and commercial establishments across Kerala was hit badly as trade union activists in the State joined their counterparts elsewhere in the country in the 24-hour strike to press their 12-point charter of demands.The strike evoked almost total response from the trade unions and service organisations. The only union staying away from the strike being the Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh (BMS). The government secretariat wore deserted look. So were government offices and educational institutions across the State with both pro-LDF and pro-UDF service organisations joining the strike.In Thiruvananthapuram, striking workers laid siege to the Central garage of the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) in the city, leaving employees of the ISRO's various units in the city and suburbs were left without transportation facilities to report for work. However, employees of various companies at the Technopark were able to join duty as they were taken in convoys with police protection.Although there are isolated reports of striking workers blocking taxis and autos that tried to ply in some part of the State and attempted assault on a Uber taxi driver in Kochi, there were no reports of any major incident of violence from anywhere till noon.
