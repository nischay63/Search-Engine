 A persistent gap between tea prices and the cost of production is affecting the viability of the industry, said Ashok Kumar Bhargava, Chairman Indian Tea Association. Tea prices for the last 10 years have risen by around six per cent, while input costs have risen by over 10 per cent. “Even high-quality teas are selling at lower prices now” he told reporters. Mr. Bhargava advocated adoption of the ‘Trustea’ certification for improving tea prices. Lower demand for better teas has also eroded the margins of companies in West Bengal and Assam, Mr. Bhargava said.
