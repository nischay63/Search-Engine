Mark sheets for the crucial SSC (Class X) board exams will not longer declare a candidate to have failed. From March 2017, those who fail in more than three papers will be marked ‘Eligible for Re-Exam’, a recent government resolution stated.If a student were to fail in just two subjects, then his mark sheet would read ‘Promoted to Std XI with ATKT (Allowed To Keep Terms)’. Also, those who manage to clear papers through ATKT will receive a combined new mark sheet with ‘Pass’on it, thus doing away with the old mark sheet. If a student fails in more than three subjects in subsequent attempts, the mark sheet would bear ‘Eligible only for Skill Development Programme’ instead of ‘Fail’.In the GR, the State Education Department admitted that of the 16 lakh SSC candidates, around 2.5 lakh failed to clear the board exams.The decision was taken to ensure that students do not either give up on studies or indulge in some ‘harmful activity’. It said that Class X results affected the overall physical and mental health of students, since failure almost blocked their options in education.However, the move was met with mixed reactions. Psychologist and special educator Shyamala Dalvi felt the change in terminology would not mean much for students, since it still means repeating the exam process. “Earlier, the state had discarded announcements of Class X merit lists, and other boards even tried to introduce graded systems. But the rat race for marks continues So, where has it helped?” she said.Instead, she said, each child should be helped to do well in what they can and con tinue progressing in studies.Niwas Shewale, prinicipal, Adarsh Night High School, said, "Students need to be taught to face the truth and failure strongly. How long can we protect them?”The writer is a freelance journalist
