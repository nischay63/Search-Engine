 Tragedy struck two families as four of their children drowned in a pond in Kandukur mandal of Ranga Reddy district on Thursday. Shilpa, 14, Srujan, 13, Nanni, 10, and Shiva, 12, went out of their houses for playing in their village of Makhan as it was a holiday. They played in the slush for some time and to clean themselves went to a pond. “Around 2.45 p.m., the children stepped into the pond unaware that it was deep. Recently, dredging was undertaken in the pond making it deeper,” Ibrahimpatnam ACP P. Narayana said. They slipped into deep waters and got drowned. The bodies were retrieved later and sent for post-mortem.
