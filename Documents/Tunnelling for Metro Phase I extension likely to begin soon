Chennai Metro Rail will soon start tunnelling work for the Phase I extension project from Washermanpet to Wimco Nagar.Only recently, Chief Minister Jayalalithaa laid foundation for the project and promised that it would be completed in three years, thereby improving mobility of commuters from north Chennai.According to CMRL sources, construction of the diaphragm wall is in progress and they hope to complete it in two months. “There is some preparatory work to be done before the tunnelling work starts. We plan to begin tunnelling by the end of October or early November for constructing the underground network for this stretch,” an official said.The project that is estimated to cost Rs. 3,770 crore is a 9 km stretch which is partly underground and partly elevated; it runs underground from Washermanpet to Korukkupet and then as an elevated corridor till Wimco Nagar.Chennai Metro Rail plans to complete the underground stretch first as it is a time-consuming project. Few months ago, Afcons Infrastructure Limited was awarded the contract for the work.Though the land acquisition process has started, there have been protests by residents against the project.The phase I project covers 45 km of the city; of this, 24 km will be underground and 21 km will be elevated. The first service between Koyambedu and Alandur was started in June last year and the next one will be launched between Little Mount and Chennai airport soon.Though the land acquisition process has started, there have been protests by residents
