To minimise accidents and prevent and detect crime, the government is planning to re-install the Closed Circuit Televisions (CCTVs), fixed at different places during the just-concluded Krishna Pushkarams, at select places in the city.Police and the Revenue officials are on the job to identify the locations where the CCTVs should be located at. The officials planned a meeting to discuss details like who will maintain the cameras.“CCTVs were installed at a few places and we detected many cases with the help of the footage. Electronic evidence has become the major clue for many cases now and we need more cameras to identify criminals and prevent crimes in the State capital,” a police officer said.CC clippings will help establish the reasons for the road accidents, steps to prevent them, take up investigation and fix the culprits, an officer told The Hindu .However, many traffic signals and the existing CC Cameras became defunct due to poor maintenance. Shortage of traffic police, poor road engineering, bad roads, poor condition of vehicles, violation of road and traffic rules were some of the reasons for accidents, said a police official deputed in traffic wing.“We planned to maintain silent vigil through e-surveillance from the CCTVs. Focus should be laid on bus and railway stations, major junctions and roads, malls, cinema theatres, temples and government offices to avoid crimes,” the official said.
