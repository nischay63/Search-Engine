 After a disruption in the operation of scheduled services since Tuesday last week, which included a complete shutdown of the Moore Market Complex (MMC) on Saturday and Sunday, normal services to Arakkonam were resumed from Monday after work on the fifth and sixth lines between the MMC and the Basin Bridge railway station was completed. However, trains towards Gummidipoondi will continue to be operated from the Basin Bridge station until next Monday. Southern Railway officials said that with the commissioning of two additional lines, Electric Multiple Unit (EMU) services between MMC and Basin Bridge would not have to be detained at signals, waiting for clearance after long distance trains on the main lines from Chennai Central cross the stretch.So far, the average speed of EMUs between MMC and Basin Bridge junction was 15 kilometres per hour and from Monday, it was increased to 30 kmph. The objective is to increase it to 45 kmph, officials said. The old crossover points were replaced with new ones, the number of control rooms and signals were reduced from three to two, enabling faster movement of EMU services with immediate effect. Trains on both directions — towards Arakkonam and Gummidipoondi — are being operated from Chennai Beach, and the free MTC bus services are being operated from MMC to Basin Bridge too, fficials added.
