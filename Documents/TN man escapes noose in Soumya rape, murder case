Govindachamy, who was sentenced to death for the rape and murder of 23-year-old Soumya Viswanathan in Kerala, escaped the noose on Wednesday after the Supreme Court found no clinching evidence to prove that he intended to kill her. The court found that the convict had only meant to rape her. Calling the rape “most brutal and grotesque”, a three-judge Bench led by Justice Ranjan Gogoi, however, upheld the lower court’s decision to put him behind bars for life. Setting aside the charge of murder, for which the convict was awarded the capital punishment, it ruled that Govindachamy was guilty of only “voluntarily causing grievous hurt” and reduced his death penalty to seven-year imprisonment.
