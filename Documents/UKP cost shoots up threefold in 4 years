 The estimated cost for the third phase of the Upper Krishna Project (UKP), aimed at irrigating 5.3-lakh hectares in nine drought-prone districts of north Karnataka, has gone up almost threefold in the last four years. The Department of Water Resources said the cost escalation was because of the increase in the quantum of compensation to land-losers.The estimated cost for the project, which was Rs. 17,000 crore in 2012, now stands at Rs. 49,500 crore. Chief Minister Siddaramaiah chaired a meeting on UKP on Friday and promised to get funds needed to complete the project.Increase in the height of Almatti reservoir from the present 519.6 metres to 524.25 metres, to utilise 130.9 tmcft of Krishna waters, will result in the submerge of around 20 villages of Vijayapura and Bagalkot districts and 10 wards of Bagalkot city. For relief and rehabilitation, the government proposed to acquire 1.34 lakh acres. Now, compensation has to be paid as per the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Rules, 2015.Of the Rs. 49,500 crore, Rs.32000 crore would have to be spent on paying compensation to land-losers. Value of the land to be compensated, which was estimated at Rs. 2 lakh per acre in 2012, has now gone up to Rs. 18 lakh to Rs. 25 lakh, said a senior official in the department. Nevertheless, the government has issued notification for land acquisition.Six lift irrigation projects, including Mulawada, Chimmalagi, Mullabad, Indi, Rampura, Koppal, and Herakal, besides expansion Narayanpur Right Bank Canal and Bhima Flank Irrigation schemes, have been taken up under the UKP third phase.However, sources said it would be difficult to commence work till the final order of Krishna Water Disputes Tribunal notifies the final order of the tribunal pronounced in 2010.
