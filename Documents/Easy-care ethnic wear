“Time is a precious commodity” says Farida Gupta, creative head of Folklore, a Delhi-based ethnic clothing venture. “The woman of today cannot afford to make multiple trips to the dry cleaners, which is why I prioritise the easy-care, wash-and-wear factor in my designs, the other highlights being comfort and affordability”. Folklore is committed to the cause of improving the standard of living of more than 200 women from underprivileged backgrounds. To this end, they are given free training in ari, kantha, kasuti and other traditional embroidery and provided with regular work orders to ensure sustainable, long-term employment.Farida works with natural fabrics, particularly hand-block printed, lightweight, soft cottons that include ajrakh, Sanganeri, shibori, indigo, dabu and Mughal floral prints. “I avoid synthetics that invariably make the heat even more unbearable. While my creations encourage craft persons to practise and revive traditional skills, they are trendy in classic styles that range from ethnic to Indo-western”. Block prints, vegetable dyes, embroidery and sequin-work come together to create hand-crafted elegance in a colour palette ranging from pastels to brilliant hues. Tailored in sizes ranging from XS to XL, the willingness to customise in order to ensure a perfect fit is another factor that adds to the growing popularity of Folklore’s collection. The range includes casual and formal wear in versatile mix-and-match kurtas, anarkalis, tops, kaftans, shararas and Farsi Pants in fabrics such as cotton, rayon and mul, specially chosen for Chennai’s humid weather. Priced between Rs. 900 –Rs. 2,500, the collection offers something for every budget.The Folklore exhibition will be held at Sri Sankara Hall, TTK Road, Alwarpet, till September 17. Timings: 10 a.m. – 8 p.m
