 Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday appealed for calm in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu after violence erupted over the Cauvery water release, saying that he was “personally pained at the developments”. “Violence cannot provide a solution to any problem. In a democracy, solutions are found through restraint and mutual dialogue. This dispute can only be solved within the legal ambit. Breaking the law is not a viable alternative,” he said in a statement.
