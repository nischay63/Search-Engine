(Only one of them will be permitted to withdraw).”The application for withdrawal should be accompanied by evidence of the wedding, including the invitation card, copies of receipts for advance payments already made such as marriage hall booking and advance payments to caterers.Further, there should be “a detailed list of persons to whom the cash withdrawn is proposed to be paid, together with a declaration from such persons that they do not have a bank account. The list should indicate the purpose for which the proposed payments are being made“.RBI also said banks should encourage families to incur wedding expenses through non—cash means through cheques or drafts, credit or debit cards, pre-paid cards, mobile transfers, Internet banking channels, NEFT/RTGS and the like.“Therefore, members of the public should be advised, while granting cash withdrawals, to use cash to meet expenses which have to be met only through cash mode,” RBI told banks.Banks have been asked to keep a proper record of the evidence and produce them for verification by the authorities in case of need.The scheme will be reviewed based on authenticity or bona fide use thereof, RBI added.
