People of Vamanjoor and surrounding places — upcoming residential localities off Mangaluru-Moodabidri Highway near the city — are having a tough time commuting to and from Kulur, Baikampady and neighbouring areas.Bus operators, who have permits to run services towards Baikampady, often cancel trips thereby inconveniencing the public.According to Vanaja Kotian, a resident of Vamanjoor, six private operators have permits to run services between Vamanjoor and Baikampady via Kavoor and Kuloor.But they never stick to the schedule.On a government holiday or a Sunday, more than half the services don’t operate. Passengers end up waiting for long hours and crowding themselves into the few buses that run, Ms. Kotian said.Kamalaksha Poojary, another resident of the area, said that there is usually a heavy rush of travellers to the Vamanjoor area that houses the Pilikula Nisargadhama on holidays and weekends.There aren’t enough buses plying even to downtown areas during peak hours. City services operate at a frequency of about 15-20 minutes from Vamanjoor to State Bank during peak hours.The services are insufficient since the area is emerging as a popular residential locality, particularly for the middle and lower-middle classes, he said.Ms. Kotian and Mr. Poojary sought action from the Regional Transport Authority against erring bus operators.Meanwhile, the KSRTC should be allowed to operate services between Vamanjoor and Baikampady to break the private bus monopoly, they said.
