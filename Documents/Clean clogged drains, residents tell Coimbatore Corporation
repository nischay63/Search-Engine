The drain along the Perur Road in Selvapuram is clogged. It has been so for a few months now as the sewage does not flow out, say residents. The problem is worse in the stretch between Muthusamy Colony and LIC Colony, complains resident T.V. Gopi.What adds to the problem is the dumping of solid waste, particularly liquor bottles, plastic containers, and plastic covers from the liquor outlet across the road.Autorickshaw driver R. Selvaraj from Thillai Nagar says it is difficult for the drivers to wait for customers there because the odour is unbearable. Plus there is the trouble from mosquitoes.The residents have complained to the Corporation but there has been very little action, the residents add.If clogged drains are the problem on the Perur Road, in the residential colonies off the road in the south, it is poorly constructed drains.Mr. Gopi says that iron rods protrude off the culvert surface and pose a threat to residents.There have been several accidents in the past and the latest is a 60-year-old woman, Aleema.Ms. Aleema says that while walking towards a grocery shop in Muthusamy Colony, she tripped off the iron road, fell with face down on the road and suffered severe bruises.Her nephew S. Kamarudeen says that that there are more than two culverts that are damaged in the area but the Corporation has taken little remedial action.Sources in the civic body said that they would soon attend to the problems.
