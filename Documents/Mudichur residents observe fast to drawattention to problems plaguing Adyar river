Around 500 residents of Mudichur and Varadharajapuram, who had united under the Joint Action Committee of Varadharajapuram and Mudichur (JACOVAM), held a hunger protest recently on Kamarajar High Road, Perungalathur.The protest was organised to draw the attention of the State government, the Kancheepuram district administration and the Public Works Department to the necessity of de-silting and deepening the Adyar river, from Adhanur, near Guduvanchery, to Anakaputhur.“The failure of the authorities, including the Kancheepuram Collectorate and the Public Works Department, to de-silt and deepen the river and its waterways and strengthen the bunds before the onset of northeast Monsoon last year caused havoc in the residential localities during the torrential rains in December ,” JACOVAM members said.“Mudichur and Varadharajapuram were the worst-affected areas during the floods as the overflowing water rose up to the first floors of residential areas, resulting in loss of lives and property,” V. Rajasekaran, president of Federation of Varadharajapuram Welfare Associations, said. “Though the northeast monsoon is almost at the door, the work is yet to be started by PWD,” JACOVAM members said.Moreover, the members also requested the PWD to construct a check-dam on the water ways. If constructed, the dam will raise the level of the water upstream or regulate its flow and this, in turn will increase the groundwater level and lake belt storage.
