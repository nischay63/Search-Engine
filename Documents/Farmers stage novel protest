TIRUCHI: Condemning Karnataka’s refusal to release water in the Cauvery as per the Supreme Court order, members of the Desiya Thennindia Nadigal Inaippu Vigasayigal Sangam staged a novel protest by resorting to a demonstration in the Cauvery River here on Thursday.Over 25 protestors staged the demonstration in knee-deep water flowing in the river. P.Ayyakannu, president of the association, condemned the Karnataka government for failing to abide by the final award of the Cauvery Tribunal and the Supreme Court order to release water in the river. The Centre has also failed to question Karnataka’s defiance of the rule of law, he said.Mr.Ayyakannu contended that Karnataka was treating Cauvery as just a drain and accused the State of releasing sewage into the river.The agitation was withdrawn after police held protracted talks with the protestors.
