 Recognising Nepal’s efforts to build a democratic polity, India on Friday expressed the hope that the government of Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal “Prachanda” would hold an “inclusive dialogue” while implementing the controversial Constitution of his country. India and Nepal held wide-ranging talks and sealed three significant deals as Mr. Prachanda’s September 15-18 visit to India unfolded.However, differences over the Constitution which led to domestic discord and disturbed ties with Delhi persisted. “We are hopeful that Nepal will successfully implement the Constitution through inclusive dialogue, accommodating the aspirations of all sections of their diverse society,” Foreign Secretary S. Jaishankar said. This remark indicated that Delhi would maintain dialogue with the Madhesi leaders who had demanded that Prime Minister Prachanda should address representational and territorial concerns of their community, within a short time span.
