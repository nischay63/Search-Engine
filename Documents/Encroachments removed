Four houses in Bharanar Street in Murugankurichi were removed during an encroachment eviction drive on Wednesday.Following complaints submitted to Collector M. Karunakaran at the weekly grievance redressal meeting recently about construction of houses on the watercourse which obstructed flow of water to Bethesda Tank, revenue officials conducted a survey and identified the encroachments. Since four houses were found to be illegal structures, the officials led by Tahsildar Balasubramanian removed the encroachments with police security.
