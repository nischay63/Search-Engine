KARIMNAGAR: Telugu Desam Party district president and former legislator Ch. Vijayaramana Rao has urged Collector Neetu Prasad to take measures for the inclusion of the Kalwa Srirampur mandal in the Peddapalli revenue division instead of the proposed Manthani revenue division. The TDP district president along with other leaders met the Collector on Monday and submitted a memorandum. He said that the Kalwa Srirampur mandal was only 21 km away from Peddapalli mandal headquarters. If the mandal was included in Manthani revenue division, the mandal people will have to travel a distance of 41 km to reach Manthani, he added.
