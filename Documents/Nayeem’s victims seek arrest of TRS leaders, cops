Members of the Telangana Praja Front alleged that slain gangster Nayeem’s encounter took place because of a clash between the ruling TRS party leaders and former naxalite with regard to land at Yadadri.They also claimed that TRS leaders and police officers as well played a role in Nayeem’s operations and demanded that they be arrested.Support victims’ families“All the family members of Nayeem’s victims should be provided with monetary support by the State Government. They should be given employment,” said Saritha, the sister of Belli Lalita, who was killed by Nayeem several years ago. Addressing a press conference along with the TPF members, Saritha stated that the Government should probe into the disappearance of people in the past who were connected to Nayeem.The TPF claimed that some TRS leaders allegedly having links with the slain gangster should be removed from their party posts, as they were involved in Nayeem’s illegal activities. They added that Nayeem’s gang members were spread across Medak, Mahbubnagar and Nalgonda districts and that they were taking shelter as TRS leaders.Investigation“Nayeem was the person behind Sohrabuddin’s encounter. The BJP was worried about it and the Government wanted to eliminate people related to the case. Nayeem was the prime evidence,” alleged N. Ravichander, vice-president, TPF. The Special Investigation Team (SIT) formed by the Government was not enough; he said and added that a former Supreme Court judge should be appointed to oversee the investigation.“Nayeem was used as a weapon by the ruling class. He eliminated about 70 to 100 people in Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Telangana and Orissa, where he tortured people whose bodies were never found,” stated Mr. Ravichander. He added that though Nayeem is dead, his associates, who are still at large, should be caught, as they can reveal the truth.
