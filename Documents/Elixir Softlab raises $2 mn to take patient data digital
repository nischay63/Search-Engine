Ltd., has developed four products -- for doctors, families, pharmacies and labs and hospitals under the hCue brand.Talking to The Hindu, T. Vijay, founder and head-finance and business development, Elixir Softlab, said: “The core of healthcare data is captured at the level of primary care, which is the starting point to create a unified, comprehensive health record for all.”According to him, such technology is currently limited to only secondary and tertiary care providers. “Our vision is to enable patients as well as every healthcare provider to get access to that data. Using our software, doctors can create a record within 60 seconds.”Having raised funding in the last few months, Elixir Softlab has rolled out its services in Chennai.
