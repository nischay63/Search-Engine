For a nation to prosper, the health and state of its women must be at the front of all decisions. The legitimacy of the surrogacy Bill rests on this (‘Being’ page – “Why the Surrogacy Bill is necessary”, Aug.28). It is not, as some argue, about snatching away the so-called right to freedom of individuals and couples, but about granting a systemised approach towards enabling a regulated sector and ultimately ensuring better health for women, the right to parenthood, and a lot more for the child who enters the world through this route. It is understandable that commercial surrogacy was a solution for a couple unable to have a biological child by natural means, but there are always other avenues to explore. Adoption is one of them. It’s time that we promote this underutilised solution to infertility.Barbie Goyal,New Delhi
