Sri Lanka’s malaria-free status is remarkable considering the political instability and the Eelam wars that it went through (Editorial – “ >Sri Lanka conquers malaria”, Sept. 8). Its success in public-private sector coordination will suggest solutions in Afghanistan and Pakistan. While India is inching closer to becoming malaria-free, it would be best if it studies the Sri Lankan model. India’s challenge is unique because of the scalability factor.Perhaps SAARC could go in a unique direction by focussing on improving health care. India’s success in eradicating polio, Bangladesh’s in gender inclusion and Bhutan’s focus on happiness as a part of development are where we could start. By focussing on health, social and gender issues, SAARC could become the first-of-its-kind regional body to focus on issues other than those of a political/economic nature.Akshay Viswanathan,Thiruvananthapuram
