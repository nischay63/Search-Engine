 St. Joseph’s College, Devagiri, in the district has become the first college in the country to get an A++ grade under the newly adopted National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) assessment system done for higher education institutions. The college, which was conferred autonomous status two years ago, secured the top A++ grade by scoring a CGPA (Cumulative Grade Point Average) of 3.76 out of 4. The NAAC, an autonomous institution of the University Grants Commission, has adopted a revised grading system with effect from July 2016. A list of the 330 institutions that were graded since July was published by NAAC last week. “Overall, we secured 940 out of the 1,000 marks in the assessment. The parameters adopted for autonomous colleges are similar to universities. For affiliated colleges, it is different,” Sibichen M. Thomas, the college Principal, said. The college has developed its own curriculum and development requirements. “Our major achievement was that we revised the syllabus for undergraduate and postgraduate courses. The examinations were modified. Now, there is no delay in results as well,” he added. All these achievements came in just two years. The college secured an A+ when it was affiliated to the Calicut University during the NAAC assessment in 2011. There are 2, 152 students in 15 UG, 11 PG courses and six research wings. “The average pass percentage in each of these courses was between 85 and 100 per cent. As many as 148 students had cleared the UGC NET/JRF examinations in the past five years,” Mr. Thomas said.Likewise, the NAAC team was impressed with the quality of the staff. Sixty five out of the 71 faulty members had doctoral degrees; most had secured foreign scholarships and published research papers in international publications. There are also 40 members attached to the self-financing courses.“The college has also made remarkable achievements in arts and sports during the inter-collegiate and zonal events,” Mr. Thomas said.
