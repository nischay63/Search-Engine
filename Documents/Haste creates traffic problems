Traffic jams have become a regular occurrence on G N Chetty Road, as motorists often take the wrong side of the road. The stretch between Bharathi Raja Speciality Hospital and Gemini flyover, which is a one-way, has motorcyclists and those commuters who take autorickshaws going down the wrong side, thereby causing a lot of problems for residents of the area.These motorists are the ones who want to reach the interior parts of T Nagar, such as Usman Road, quickly, without having to go via Cathedral Road or around Anna Salai, adding an extra 10 to 15 minutes to their travel time.“Going down the right side would mean mean extra travel time and expenditure of fuel. Since the one-way stretches for only 1.5 km, it is easier to just go the wrong way,” says B Balakrishnan, who works at a shop on the road.“This tactic is used only by people who stay around T. Nagar and have to travel short distances within the area. Commuters from other parts of the city tend to follow the one-way rule,” says C. Ravi, who takes G.N. Chetty Road frequently.Although barricades have been put up by Traffic Police, they don’t seem to deter the violators. “Due to the barricades, those using four-wheelers cannot go the wrong way, but those travelling by motorcycles and autorickshaws manage to squeeze their way through,” adds Ravi.Traffic policemen are not found here during most hours of the day and this problem is acutely felt between 10 a.m. and 12 noon and between 3 p.m. and 5 p.m.. During these hours, traffic personnel have to be around to regulate traffic, says Balakrishnan.Efforts to reach the traffic officials to discuss the issue proved futile.
