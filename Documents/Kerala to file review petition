Many working women, who commute daily in overcrowded buses and trains, came on television and expressed solidarity with the victim, a saleswoman who was murdered a day before her betrothal. The initial news that the accused had “got away with a light seven-year sentence” animated the Opposition parties to break the Onam holiday with aggressive protest marches and statements.
