In a pre-dawn operation, a special team from the Customs Preventive Unit in Rameswaram seized 17 kg of ganja, buried in sand in the fourth islet, and launched an investigation into suspected smuggling of the narcotics to Sri Lanka.Acting on a tip-off, the CPP led by Superintendents M. Pugazhendi and S. Jothimani and assisted by the Mandapam Station of Indian Coast Guard seized the contraband buried at two spots in the islet on Wednesday morning.As the boat given to the CPU in Rameswaram was not in good condition, the CPP secured the Hovercraft of the ICG and unearthed the drug packed in eight packets, each weighing a little more than two kg, with the assistance of coast guard personnel, sources said.The seized contraband could have been the ‘leftover’ of a bigger consignment smuggled to Sri Lanka, the sources said. The CPP, comprising J. Karunakaran, Communication Supervisor, and two others, with coast guard personnel searched the islet for about an hour but could find only the eight packets, Mr. Pugazhendi said.Meanwhile, a special team from the Additional Commissionerate of Customs here, which had seized two kg of suspected ephedrine near a hotel on Devakottai-Karaikudi road near Amaravathiputhur last week, started a probe on Wednesday on two men who were in possession of the drug and fled on seeing the customs personnel. Assistant Commissioner of Customs E. Clement Jeevananthan said the special team visited the hotel and checked the ledger and video footage of CCTV cameras installed in the hotel to check the identities of the suspected drug peddlers. Customs sleuths mounted surveillance in the area when the peddlers, sensing trouble, escaped by running away from the scene after dropping a bag which contained the contraband.
