“Restoring campus democracy is a priority”, said Rama Naga, former general secretary of the Jawaharlal Nehru University Students’ Union and member of All India Students’ Association (AISA), a day after the Left alliance of AISA and Students Federation of India (SFI) won all four seats in the JNUSU elections.Together, the SFI and the AISA bagged the posts of president, vice-president, general secretary and joint secretary.The BJP-affiliated Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) and the Congress-backed National Students’ Union of India (NSUI) were nowhere in the contest, even as the newly founded Birsa Ambedkar Phule Students’ Association (BAPSA) gave a close fight.Mr. Naga was among the JNU students charged with sedition for raising anti-India slogans during a campus event on February 9 to mark the death anniversary of Parliament attack convict Azfal Guru. Speaking to The Hindu about 2016 JNUSU elections – the first student polls in the university since the controversial February 9 event that led to calls for reining in student activism and checking the growth of ‘anti-national’ elements on campus, Mr. Naga said: "This is a mandate against the shutdown of JNU.”“The students have made it very clear – they do not want ABVP in the campus and the BJP outside. The mandate could not have been clearer,” he said.Talking about the way forward he said “We have had too many issues, including restrictions on public meetings and dhaba closure among others. All this will be looked into. Then there are students’ problems like the hostel issue which need to be addressed immediately.”Sunday was “celebrated as a rest day’’ after hectic election-related activities, he said. “On Monday night, we will take out a “Stand with JNU march” which will be about unity and standing up for JNU.”
