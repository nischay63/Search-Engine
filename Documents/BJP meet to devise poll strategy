The three-day Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) national council session in Kozhikode will devise a clear strategy for bolstering the organisational network to tackle the Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh and Punjab Assembly elections and also for making a strong foray into the south Indian States, well ahead of the Lok Sabha polls in 2019.The meeting takes place in the backdrop of the Patidar and Dalit uprising in Gujarat, reports of the Jats alienating themselves from the party in Uttar Pradesh, and the Aam Aadmi Party consolidating its position to come to power in Punjab.In the wake of such developments, even a minor electoral setback could prove dearly for a party that is yearning for continued governance at the Centre.The national leadership has the onerous task of retaining power in Gujarat and wresting power in Uttar Pradesh and Punjab. Being a precursor to the Lok Sabha elections, the outcome of the Assembly elections would provide a touchstone for the popularity of the National Democratic Alliance and relevance of a slew of programmes and projects it had rolled out during the past two years. Though political adversaries predict a setback for the BJP in the Assembly elections and also a significant decline in prospects in the Lok Sabha polls, the national leadership, party sources say, has the confidence of bettering its prospects in all elections slated to be held over the next three years.Still, the party has decided to consolidate its base in south India, especially Kerala, and the three-day session from September 23 to 25 would finetune a strategy to attain this goal by reaching out to the Dalits and other marginalised sections and also shedding the perceived upper caste tag of the party. Better position Compared to the last session held in Thiruvananthapuram in 1991, the party has improved its position by opening account in the State Assembly through veteran leader O. Rajagopal and registered its presence prominently in a significant number of local self-government institutions across the State, mainly Thiruvananthapuram Corporation. The party had emerged runners up in a number of Assembly seats and now is hopeful of improving its chances in the years ahead. The national council would iron out plans for bringing in more communities, especially different denominations of the Christian community, and other marginalised sections into the NDA fold in the State. The form and relevance of the present NDA State unit too would come up for review at the session. It would also have to think of means for enlivening the party machinery to take the details of the welfare initiatives of the Narendra Modi government to the micro level, sources say.
