Getting a learner’s licence (LL) will become easy across the State with an online written test replacing the current system of evaluation by a motor vehicle inspector.The new system, which is being tried on a pilot basis, will be fully operational in two months at 10 Regional Transport Offices (RTOs) in Bengaluru, said C. Mallikarjun, Joint Commissioner for Transport (Environment and e-Governance).Under the new system, one needs to file an application form and upload the documents online, take an appointment, appear for the computerised test, and instantly know the results.Sarathi is the application of Ministry of Road Transport and Highways that provides pan-India database of drivers.Under the existing Sarathi III, one files online applications for LL and Driving Licence (DL), but has to take a written test at the jurisdictional RTO. Aspirants spend at least a day completing the formalities.Instant resultsBesides helping offices become paperless and making the process quicker, Sarathi IV ushers in transparency with instant results after the computerised test, Mr. Mallikarjun said.A similar procedure will be adopted for DLs too, but in a scaled-down manner.As not all RTOs are equipped with computerised driving test tracks, it will be limited to offices with the facility.At present, applicants can take the test in Kannada or English, and the department is exploring options of other widely spoken languages. Illiterate people can take an audio test. As many as 15 multiple choice questions have to be answered in 15 minutes. If the candidate is successful, the officer approves the LL.
