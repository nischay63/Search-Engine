The Bihar government on Friday moved the Supreme Court against the bail granted to Mohd. Shahabuddin. The move is likely to widen the cracks in the ruling Mahagathbandhan, or Grand Allaince, between Chief Minister Nitish Kumar’s Janata Dal (United [JD(U)], Lalu Prasad’s Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) and the Congress.Mr Shahabuddin, a former RJD member of Parliament, allegedly has over 50 criminal cases against him and he has been convicted in eight. He was released on bail on September 7.The Nitish Kumar government challenged the Patna High Court order releasing Mr Shahabuddin citing a six-month delay in his trial.Petitions to be clubbedThe State government’s petition came a few hours after the Supreme Court allowed a plea by Siwan-resident Chandrakeshwar Prasad, whose three young sons were allegedly killed by Mr Shahabuddin’s henchmen over a decade ago, for an urgent hearing in his separate petition challenging the bail order. A bench led by Chief Justice of India T.S. Thakur agreed to list Mr. Prasad’s case for hearing on September 19 after his counsel, senior advocate Prashant Bhushan, made an urgent mention in court.It is likely that the Bihar government’s identical plea will also find a mention when Mr. Prasad’s case comes up for hearing.The State government agreed with Mr. Prasad that Mr Shahabuddin has a criminal background and that the High Court ought to have considered his antecedents before granting him bail.“It’s not the release of the Mohd Shahabuddin which has annoyed Nitish Kumar and his partymen but his statement saying that he was the CM of circumstances,” said a senior RJD leader, a view JD (U) sources concurred with.
