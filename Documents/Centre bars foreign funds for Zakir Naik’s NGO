The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) issued a gazette notification banning Islamic preacher Zakir Naik’s NGO from receiving foreign funds. The MHA had earlier placed the NGO — the Islamic Research Foundation (IRF) — under the prior permission category through an executive order and on Monday issued a notification also, which cannot be challenged under the Foreign Contributions Regulation Act (FCRA) 2010.The notification said the IRF had violated certain provisions of the FCRA Act and therefore, “would obtain prior permission from central government before accepting any foreign contribution”.Issuance of a gazette notification under Section 11(3) of the FCRA 2010 is rare, said an official.The notification said the decision to place it under the prior permission category was taken after the Centre was convinced that it had violated FCRA rules.Mr Naik’s NGO was served an inspection notice on August 8 and on August 19, the MHA renewed its FCRA license through the online system. Following this, four officials were suspended.
