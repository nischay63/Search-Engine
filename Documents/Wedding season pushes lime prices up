The price of lime has touched Rs.160 a kg as demand has increased in view of the wedding season. Lime is an integral part of Hindu weddings and all the guests are given a lime each while they leave.Lime reaches the markets here mainly from the farms of Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh. But currently traders give the quality tag only for those coming from Tamil Nadu farms, especially Thenkasi.It is the Tamil Nadu limes which fetch Rs.160 a kg in the retail markets. About 20 make a kg and that means Rs.8 for one. The Andhra Pradesh limes are not ripe ones and tagged as inferior quality because these cannot be used for making lime juice. Yet these limes sell at prices ranging from Rs.90 to Rs.100 a kg in the wholesale markets. The Andhra limes mainly go for pickles and to be given to wedding guests. Bad weather caused blooms of lime trees to drop in Andhra Pradesh. It is the fruits from the later bloom which is being harvested now.Farmers are harvesting them to cash-in on the demand. The next Malayalam month of Kanni will see lime prices falling as there will hardly be any Hindu wedding during that month. On an average, four lorry loads of lime, each weighing 10 tonnes, arrive each day at the Kollam wholesale markets.
