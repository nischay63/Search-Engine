This includes two luxury hotels on Willingdon Island and Fort Kochi and a supermarket in Ernakulam North.The auditors have pulled up the officials for not responding to three consecutive notes regarding the illegal functioning of the shops in the city, the report said.The civic authority also failed to ensure that the shops that had obtained the licences earlier renewed them on time. It was the responsibility of the officials of the Health Wing of the local body to ensure that the shops are functioning after obtaining the mandatory licence. “The local body has sustained huge revenue loss on this account,” the auditors said.Illegal slaughteringThe auditors have put on record the thriving illegal slaughtering of animals for meat in the city.
