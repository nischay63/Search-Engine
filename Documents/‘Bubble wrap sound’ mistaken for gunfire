 The sound that sparked a lock-down at a suburban Philadelphia military academy was most likely caused by bubble wrap being popped, and not gunfire, officials said. A student who lives in an Eastern University apartment building located on the property of the Valley Forge Military Academy and College heard what she thought were shots firedon Monday evening and called 911, academy officials said in a statement. Police from Radnor and Tredyffrin Townships responded, and the academy, Eastern University and nearby Cabrini University were all placed on lockdown while police searched the area. They found no weapons or evidence of any weapon being fired at any time, and no one was injured, officials said. — AP
