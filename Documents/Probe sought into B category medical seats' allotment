Participants in a roundtable organised by the Students’ Federation of India (SFI) on the counselling for admission to B category seats held at Dr. NTR University of Health Sciences (NTRUHS), demanded that the government institute a probe by a sitting judge into the irregularities.They have resolved to stage protests across the State if re-counselling is not held.Addressing the gathering, former Minister and YSR Congress leader Kolusu Parthasarathy said the government remained a mute spectator as medical seats were sold for hefty sums by private colleges which formed into a cartel.CPI State Secretary K. Ramakrishna said Health Minister Kamineni Srinivas had said that he was ready for an investigation but thereafter kept quiet as it was the corporate forces that called the shots. The medical seats due to the State as per Article 371 (D) should have been allotted to candidates from the State but the rules were blatantly violated. Former MLC K.S. Lakshman Rao said the conduct of the State government was such that it defied the Constitution. CPI (M) State committee member Y.V. Rao said several seats to be given to candidates from the State were allotted to outsiders.SFI State secretary S. Noor Mohammed questioned the need to conduct counselling for B category seats without filling the ‘A’ seats first. The A and B category seats used to be filled under the aegis of Eamcet convener. As the private colleges were later given the freedom to fill B seats, money running into several crores changed hands, he alleged.Participants in a roundtable resolve to stage protests across the State if re-counselling is not held
