 At a time when the local body is attempting to make the city ‘smart’, lack of basic facilities and negligence of authorities are visibly pushing back the city’s image.Over the past couple of months, many areas and roads got completely transformed with a new look. But the practice of running Sunday seafood markets, literally on the roads, is continuing at various locations, including Chuttugunta junction, Sunnapubattilu Centre, Veterinary Colony and others. Though these markets are convenient to the local buyers who need not rush to the few authorised fish markets, for commuters and locals they are causing inconvenience not just for a day but all through the week.Official apathy“The vendors occupy half of the road spreading seafood products and buyers block the other half parking their vehicles which hinder vehicular movement on the road. This is happening since the past couple of years and none of the officials of local elected representatives bothers to find a solution,” said senior citizen L. Balaram at Chuttugunta. In the beginning these markets functioned only early morning but as police and municipal officials turned a blind eye activity is going on till noon.“Food is important to all but the way it is sold must not be a problem. Even three days after Sunday, passers-by experience stinking odour from wastage dumped in the drains”, said another local Sk. Noor. Stray dogs also feed on the sea food waste and get used to eating meat, which is one of the reasons behind attacks on people.
