 The sale of locally cultivated safe-to-eat vegetables, pokkali rice and value added products from it, and coconut oil under the aegis of the district unit of the CPI(M) saw a total turnover of more than Rs.2 crore over a period of 10 days in the run up to Thiruvonam.The vegetables came from over 700 acres under various local committees of the CPI (M), said M. M. Abbas of ‘Jaiva Jeevitham’ programme, which was initiated two years ago with an aim of producing safe-to-eat vegetables and fruits. Price cutHe said there were 250 outlets that sold the vegetables and other produce. The farmers got about 90 per cent of the price as these shops were mostly run by farmers’ groups. Increased availability of safe-to-eat vegetables was one of the key features of the Onam market this year. This resulted in about 30 per cent price cut compared to the previous year. Around three tonnes of safe-to-eat rice was also sold through the various outlets ahead of Onam. Boost to farming According to the organisers, the sale and demand for pokkali rice was encouraging for farmers, who have been abandoning its cultivation because of the rising cost. Besides pokkali rice, rice from a group of farmers in Kanjoor was sold briskly during the period along with rare variety of rice from Wayanad.
