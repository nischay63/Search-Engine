Non-governmental organisation Change India has, in a petition to the Governor-Chancellor of State-run universities, expressed concern over the vacancies for the post of Vice Chancellors.The delay in appointing VCs was affecting the functioning of the universities, including completion of Ph Ds by candidates. The letter, written by A. Narayanan, director of the NGO, states that there appears to be a stalemate in the search process in at least two universities – Madurai Kamaraj University and the University of Madras.The MKU VC’s term ended on April 8, 2015 and though a three-member search panel was constituted two days ahead of the end of the VC’s tenure, there was little progress. One of the members resigned in February citing irregularities and lack of transparency.The NGO had petitioned the High Court over “confusing and conflicting advertisements inviting applications from prospective candidates” for the VC’post and sought direction to comply with the provisions of the UGC Act for VC appointments. The Court disposed the case but precious little has happened since then, Mr. Narayanan has pointed out.
