Durgam Kshetriya Vitrak (DKV) distributorships for supply of LPG refills have been sanctioned to six places in Visakha Agency by the Union Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gases. Joint Collector J. Nivas has earlier written to the Union Ministry to sanction new agencies since the existing three agencies, at Paderu, Pedabayalu and Koyyuru are not able to meet the demand from consumers in 11 mandals, particularly those living in the remote villages, who are facing a lot of difficulties in receiving LPG refills.Deputy Secretary of the Ministry K.M. Mahesh has sent a letter permitting the district administration to open LPG distribution agencies under the DKV category. The new distributionships would be opened at Munchingput, Dumbriguda, G. Madugula, Hukumpeta, Sileru and Kasipatnam under nomination method under the supervision of ITDA, Paderu. They would be opened soon, Mr. Nivas said.
