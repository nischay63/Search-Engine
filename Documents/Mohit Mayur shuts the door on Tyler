 India’s Mohit Mayur Jayaprakash did not break a sweat on his way to a 6-3, 6-3 win over Tyler Hochwalt of the United States in a first round singles clash of the LMW-ITF Futures tournament at the Perks Tennis Centre here on Tuesday.Tyler, the only foreigner in fray, was expected to give Mohit a run for his money. But the latter had other plans. He knew Tyler’s big strength was his serves. So, he engaged the American in long rallies.And, Tyler succumbed to the pressure. The 23-year-old Mohit broke his opponent at 2-2 and gathered confidence from there to clinch the first set 6-3.Tyler, who is four years older to Mohit, was not one to give up that easy. He broke the latter in the opening game of the second set but Mohit replied with a break in the next two games to gain a 3-1 lead. He played scintillating tennis thereafter to wrap the set and match 6-3.Interestingly, Tyler had lost a first round clash to the Indian in a similar tournament in Chennai last week. “I have played in the opener last week and I was quite aware of his strengths. I rallied a lot but he was quite consistent and went only for a few shots. I also tried to put the pressure on him by keeping his first serves in,” said Mohit.There was more to cheer for the home crowd as N. Sriram Balaji, the sixth seed, fashioned a similar 6-3, 6-3 win over his country-mate Dhakshineswar Suresh for a place in the next round.Meanwhile, Sumit Nagal, Prajnesh Gunneswaran and Vishnu Vardhan, the top three seeds advanced into the next round with relative ease.The results (Indians otherwise mentioned): Main draw: First round: N. Sriram Balaji bt Dhakshineswar Suresh 6-3, 6-3; Aryan Goveas bt V.M.
