 Jaheer Hussain, who has a small shop under the Usman Road flyover at T. Nagar, lost most of the stock he had been storing during the massive floods last year. He is still repaying interest for the loan that he borrowed long ago.Several street vendors who were affected during the torrential downpour last year are still struggling to restart their business. Hussain still remembers that day vividly. “I usually store the goods in a godown on Ranganathan Street after sales. I couldn’t enter the area for two days. I found that goods worth about Rs. 35,000 were under water. I had to stay at home without work for a month,” said Hussain, who had to borrow money once again to buy fresh goods. Though the State government announced a loan scheme, not many benefitted from it, street vendors in T.Nagar said. “I generally don’t make much during rainy days. But after last year’s floods, even meeting basic needs was difficult for many months,” said Vasuki, a vegetable vendor at Koyambedu. Over 1.5 lakh street vendors in the city suffered losses during the floods, as much as Rs. 50,000 in some cases. But very few vendors got the government’s financial assistance, noted V. Mageshvaran, State general secretary, Tamil Nadu Street Vending Workers Federation. The association helped 600 street vendors get loans through banks last year. “We have been demanding that the affected street vendors must be provided with loan assistance and subsidies. Flood protection measures are also essential,” he said.The association wants the State government to provide loans with low interest to vendors.
