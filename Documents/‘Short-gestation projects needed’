Taking up short gestation irrigation projects, drawing up specific development plans and demands from mandal to region-level and political leaders turning more independent and assertive on what is good for the region are among the solutions to address the backwardness of the resource-rich North Andhra region, CPI(M) Polit Bureau member B.V. Raghavulu has said.Addressing a seminar on “Constraints for the development of North Andhra - Charting out strategies for a change,” organised by Institute for Economic and Social Justice and Forum for North Andhra, he said while Rayalaseema suffered from scarce water resources, North Andhra has an average rainfall of1000 mm. However, with hills being close to sea and the gradient high water was flowing fast into it. Besides, the region still lags behind in exploiting groundwater through bore-wells even after the supply of free power.Mr. Raghavulu said the government’s irrigation schemes should be tailored in a manner suitable to North Andhra conditions.Not having scope for big projects in which contractors would be interested seemed to be a major hindrance, he said.Small land holdings, low productivity (of paddy), lack of resources to scale up agriculture, low credit deposit ratio, literacy not improving more to enable people assert their rights and the plight of Girijans were also affecting the region’s development, he said. Mr. Raghavulu said development of Visakhapatnam was not synonymous with North Andhra’s progress.The city’s growth was benefiting leaders while the region was languishing with people not being able to utilise the opportunities, he said.Institute for Economic and Social Justice Chairman K.S. Chalam said the 10 papers submitted in the seminar would deal with issues of infrastructure and themes of under development.
