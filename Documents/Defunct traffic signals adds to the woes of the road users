 The defunct traffic signals’ posts’ at the junction of Velachery Main Road, and Pallavaram-Thoraipakkam 200-Feet Radial Road have failed to draw the attention of the authorities concerned adding to the woes of the road-users, who commute daily through the intersection. The signals’, for nearly an one year, has remained non-functional till date. It is the busiest intersection on the arterial thoroughfares connecting Velachery, Tambaram, Medavakkam, Chromepet, and Rajiv Gandhi Salai or IT Corridor. “ Despite construction of flyovers ( Velachery MRTS Railway Station, and Dr. Kamakshi Memorial Hospital) to ease traffic congestion, traffic has remained chaotic in the vicinity. Adding fuel to the fire is non-functioning of six traffic signals’ posts’ at the junction. A chaos prevails during the peak hours. The authorities concerned must take steps to repair the defunct traffic signals. Traffic signals play a vital role in transporting vehicular traffic in the right directions,” S. Mahesh, a techie, said. Disciplined road-users should be very alert, when crossing this junction, as this intersection can prove to be a death trap. Vehicles coming from Pallavaram-Thoraipakkam 200-Feet Radial Road, and Velachery Main Road do not bother to stop, and come in the wrong directions to enter both stretches, he pointed out. “ Undisciplined road-users come at such a speed scaring others. It is a common sight to see many vehicle users forced to apply sudden brakes to avoid collisions,” A. Rebecca John, an IT Professional, and a resident of Camp Road, said. Pedestrians are the worst-affected. Constant flow of vehicular traffic from all directions at the intersection makes it difficult for pedestrians to cross the road.
