 A responsible knock by Namma Shivamogga opener Sadiq Kirmani (69, 63b) went in vain as Hubli Tigers recorded a two-wicket win in the opening Karbonn Karnataka Premier League (KPL) match, held at the KSCA Rajnagar stadium here on Saturday.After Shivamogga was put in to bat, opener Kirmani hit the ground running with some handsome strokes. His partner Nikin Jose (37) holed out to long-off, where Stallin Hoover took a smart diving catch. The unit then lost its next five wickets for 46 runs. Shivamogga ended its innings on 129 for six. Left-arm pacer S. Arvind (three for 15) emerged as the most successful bowler.The chase was led by M. Taha (23, 13b), Kunal Kapoor (35, 30b), and N.V. Prasad (22 n.o., 19b). Left-arm spinner Abrar Kazi (three for 23) proved to be a threat, but Tigers managed to cross the finish line with six balls to spare.In another fixture, contributions from Raju Bhatkal (48, 29b), K. Gowtham (36, 20b), Arjun Hoysala (22, 32b) and R. Jonathan (21 n.o., 18b) guided Mysuru Warriors past Mangalore United. Fifties from C.M. Gautam and M. Nidesh helped Mangalore reach 148 for seven, but Mysuru reached the target with a little under three overs to spare.The scores: Namma Shivamogga 129 for six in 20 overs (Sadiq Kirmani 69, Nikin Jose 37, S. Arvind three for 15, S. Hoover two for 15) lost to Hubli Tigers 133 for eight in 19 overs (M. Taha 23, Kunal Kapoor 35, N.V. Prasad 22 n.o., Abrar Kazi three for 23).Mangalore United 148 for seven in 20 overs (C.M. Gautam 64, M. Nidesh 54, Adithya Sagar two for 27, Vyshak Kumar two for 31) lost to Mysuru Warriors 149 for three in 17.1 overs (Raju Bhatkal 48, K. Gowtham 36, Arjun Hoysala 22, R. Jonathan 21 n.o.).
