AMRAVATI: Around one lakh people belonging to the dominant Maratha community in Maharashtra participated in a silent protest rally in Amravati district on Thursday as part of the community’s ongoing State-wide campaign demanding reservation and amendments to the SC-ST Atrocities act.Thursday’s rally was the tenth such march in the last one month. The trigger for the Maratha protest was the brutal gang rape and murder of a teenage Maratha girl in Khopardi village of Ahmednagar district in July this year.The organisers claimed that more than 10 lakh people participated in Thursday’s silent protest rally, however, Amravati Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP) Shashikumar Meena said the turnout was between 90,000 to one lakh.The protestors gathered at Nehru stadium in the morning and marched towards the District Collector’s office situated three kilometers away, putting five young girls in front.The young girls then submitted their memoranda of demands to the DC.“Our community needs to be given reservation now. Most of Maratha youngsters are jobless despite having proper education,” said Prashant Mohile, a MCA student from Paratwada town.Advocate Jitendra Deshmukh, who is also a secretary of Amravati Bar Association, claimed that the Atrocities Act was being misused especially against Marathas.“It cannot be repealed but it should be amended to prevent its misuse,” added Mr. Deshmukh.The well-organised protesters also demanded capital punishment for the culprits of Khopardi gang-rape and proper rate for the agriculture produce.No Maratha group or political party openly claimed to be behind the silent protest rally.“It’s a morcha (protest march) by Sakal Maratha Samaj (entire Maratha community) involving all 12 sub-castes,” claimed Subhash Bhokre, one of the volunteers deployed to manage the crowd.BJP leader and Minister in Devendra Fadnavis government Pravin Pote and Ranjeet Patil also participated in the silent rally.When asked whether he was participating in the rally as a representative of the State government, Mr. Pote refused to respond.“The protest was peaceful. We had deployed 1,250 personnel out of our complete staff of 1,800,” Mr. Meena said.
