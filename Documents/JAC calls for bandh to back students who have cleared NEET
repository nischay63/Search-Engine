The Joint Action Committee of Puducherry State Parents-Students Welfare Association has called for a bandh on September 3 to mark their protest against the government for ignoring the interest of students and supporting the management regarding admission of students selected under the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET).Talking to reporters here on Saturday, Vai Balasubramaniam and M. Narayanasamy of JAC said 717 seats are available in private medical colleges and 225 seats in dental colleges. The seats should be filled based on merit of students in NEET.But no step had been taken by the government to ensure that students who had cleared NEET were selected for counselling. Management of private medical colleges were also trying to let down students. The Association condemned Health Minister Malladi Krishna Rao’s statement asking the management of private medical colleges to allot 10 per cent of seats to students from the Union Territory.This showed that the government was indirectly supporting the management to evade statutory obligations of allotting seat to students who had cleared NEET.The States of Kerala, Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh had already gone ahead with implementation of 50 per cent quota and statutory adherence to selection of students.The idea of NEET was to prevent management of private medical colleges from collecting hefty fees from the students. But, this purpose had now been defeated in Puducherry due to the attitude of the government.
