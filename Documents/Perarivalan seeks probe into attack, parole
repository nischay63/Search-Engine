 A day after he was attacked by a fellow inmate in the Vellore Central Prison for Men, A.G. Perarivalan, life convict in the Rajiv Gandhi assassination case, has urged the Chief Minister to order a probe into the attack and grant him parole.Rajesh Khanna alias Raj Kumar, also a life convict, had attacked Perarivalan with an iron rod on Tuesday morning. Perarivalan sustained injury on his head, for which he received two stitches.His advocate K. Sivakumar, who met him at the prison on Wednesday, said he had suffered a fracture in the toe in the attack. “Perarivalan has asked the Prison Superintendent to permit him to talk to Rajesh for two minutes. He has no idea on why he was attacked and is yet to recover from the shock. He told me that Rajesh used to talk to him regularly,” he said.He had also asked the government to provide him treatment at a higher medical centre. “He is already suffering from high blood pressure, urological and orthopaedic ailments. Following injuries in this attack, it will be better if he is treated at the Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital in Chennai as only this hospital has rheumatology and urology specialities,” Mr. Sivakumar said.His application seeking parole has been pending for the last eight months, while his mother Arputhammal had made a plea in January. “Perarivalan has urged the government to grant him parole to stay with his family in such a situation,” he said.
