This child prodigy, studying in Class 1 in a private school, is already making waves in her neighbourhood.Meet M. Hasini, a doting daughter of Jyothi and Uma Shankar, who is working as a junior assistant in the Police Department.“Hasini can solve magic square which contains 10,201 blocks and can tell names of the countries, capitals, Presidents, Prime Ministers, Governors and Chief Ministers of the States confidently,” said the parents, who reside at Seetharamapuram.“Initially, we taught her numbers, names of places, capitals and important personalities which she used to remember well. Surprised by her memory power, we gradually taught her important days in calendars”.“Much to our surprise, she replied the important days and events for the last two decades instantaneously. She also remembers names of the States, flag symbols, rivers and seas,” Mr. Uma Shankar told The Hindu .“The six-year-old girl is good at numbers and if we give some date in 2020, she will tell on which day it falls and if one asks about a festival in a particular year a decade ago, she will tell the month, date and the week, of the festival,” her parents said.“Hasini gave many performances in her school and won the accolades of her teachers,” said the girl’s mother.
