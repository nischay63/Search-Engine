: In a measure aimed at enhancing transparency and eliminating red-tapism, the government plans to introduce an online File Tracking System (FTS) to check the status of every file in all line departments in the Union Territory.Revenue Minister M.O.H.F. Shahjahan said the new system would enable the user to retrieve, find or track files from wherever the system was being accessed. Besides eliminating the manual registers, the system would also help officials track all gazettes and circulars of the government, and know why a file has been pending for several days. Every department had been provided with a template and the FTS would be implemented within six months, he said, adding that the system was a first step towards creating paperless governance. Prospective employees with IT skills in all departments would be identified and provided training on FTS. Earlier, Mr. Shahjahan launched the issue of digitised Field Measurement Book (FMB) through Common Service Centres. He pointed out that the digitisation of FMBs had already been completed in Puducherry region. The system would enable landowners to gain access to the FMBs and track or check the status of their land holdings online. The FMBs can be downloaded manually at Common Service Centres. The FMB does not require any signature or seal and its veracity could be checked on the website https://puduvaisevai.pdy.gov.in, he said.
