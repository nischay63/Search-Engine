The Delhi government has ordered a probe into the chikungunya deaths reported in the national capital in the last two days.Four persons have succumbed to the vector-borne disease at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital.“Four deaths due to chikungunya reported from one pvt hospital [Sir Ganga Ram]. No deaths in any Delhi govt. hospital. Inquiry ordered,” Delhi Health Minister, Satyendar Jain, tweeted.“Medically, there is no death due to chikungunya, but media is showing deaths due to this disease. I want to make it clear that chikungunya is not fatal. There are 200 deaths in Delhi every day, but nobody asks about it,” he told a press conference.Doctors say that chikungunya is not a life-threatening disease in general, but, in rare cases, can lead to complications that are fatal, especially among children and old persons.Sources said the probe would seek to find the exact cause of death.Mr. Jain had also accused the Lt. Governor of “paralysing” the health system in Delhi.The Health Minister also carried out inspections at five Delhi government hospitals and appealed to people to not panic.
