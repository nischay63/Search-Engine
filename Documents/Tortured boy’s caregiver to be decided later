A decision as to whether the State should take over the protection of Noufal — the Idukki boy undergoing treatment at the Ernakulam Medical College after being brutally tortured by his parents — would only be taken after receiving a detailed report, decided the council for protection of children’s rights that met here on Saturday.The meeting discussed the need for a bystander for the child, now in intensive care, but a decision on this was not taken in the wake of the RMO reporting that the boy was being taken care of adequately.While the government will bear the boy’s treatment expense, the question over his custodianship will be addressed after his discharge from hospital. Meanwhile, the Adimali Police have initiated steps to arrest the child’s father, now under treatment.
