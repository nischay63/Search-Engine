BJP president Amit Shah has called upon his party members to celebrate Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s birthday, on September 17, as ‘Sewa Diwas’ or service day by participating in social work. In a message released by Mr. Shah, he said that it was “a matter of great pride that many committed party workers had arranged participation in activities related to social service to mark Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s birthday.
