: Aam Aadmi Party MLA from Kirari, Rituraj Govind, has written to the National Minorities Commission alleging involvement of BJP and RSS in the assault on three persons over cow slaughter. “The accused, who brutally thrashed the victims, had identified themselves as Gau Rakshaks (cow vigilantes). A few elements were deliberately trying to give the incident a communal angle,” he wrote. Referring to the alleged gang-rape of two girls in Aman Vihar, Mr. Govind said the area had earned the dubious distinction of being “most unsafe” in the absence of a robust law and order machinery. Earlier in the day, AAP leaders condemned the attack, and blamed the ‘Modi’ police.
