With just little over five weeks left for Dasara festival, the day on which the notified new districts would come into existence, the district administration has hastened the process of finalising suitable buildings in Kothagudem to house the Collectorate of the proposed Kothagudem district.Officials of the Revenue and other government departments have already identified around 18 buildings, mostly belonging to the Singareni Collieries Company Ltd (SCCL) for important government offices, including the Collectorate and camp offices of top officials.The SCCL (Planning and Project) wing’s old building adjoining the company’s head office in Kothagudem has been tentatively identified for the Collectorate considering its central location and proximity to bus stand and railway station, sources said.Four bungalows of the SCCL situated near the 3 Incline Park are among those identified for official residences of Collector, Superintendent of Police, Joint Collector and ASP, sources added. A team of officials of various government departments recently visited several old and new buildings of the SCCL under the aegis of Kothagudem MLA Jalagam Venkat Rao as part of efforts to create basic infrastructure for the new government offices set to come up in the proposed district headquarters.“We are awaiting specific guidelines from the government to finalise suitable buildings and create the requisite infrastructure facilities for government offices in the coal town,” said a Revenue official, who did not wish to be identified.
