 The virtues attached to the growing Internet network notwithstanding, pockets of darkness pockmark Kochi’s journey to the status of a smart city, as yet another incident of online sex trade comes to light.According to the police, flesh trade through online methods has made deep inroads into the city with more unscrupulous elements making use of free websites to ply their trade. But the technical issues attached to tracing the location of these websites are hindering the police from plugging the route.For instance, Locanto, a classifieds website used by the online sex racket in Kochi, is a worldwide online web portal with presence in over 50 countries. Three main cities in the State, Kochi, Thiruvananthapuram and Kozhikode, are on the list of places where the website provides its service. A cursory check of its community link still brings out a host of messages and solicitations to various sexual services.“The server of the website is located outside India, and hence, it is difficult for us to reach out to them and shut down its operation. “Hence, we are tracing culprits one by one and put all these platforms under surveillance,” said S. Sreejith, Inspector General of police, Ernakulam Range.The earlier operation was launched to detect non-consensual and underage sex work and protect its victims from further exploitation. The operation, having the elements of a sting operation, was carried out using civilian informants while police decoys were deployed for mediating with the rackets before nabbing them.
