 A 70-year-old man charged with abetting the suicide of his daughter-in-law and lodged at the Chanchalguda Central prison died due to cardiac arrest on Sunday. N Shanker, a retired employee was arrested by the police some days ago along with his wife Uma and son Mohan Rao after his daughter-in-law Sushruta had committed suicide at their house in Saidabad. Sushruta was allegedly beaten up by her in-laws after she reportedly overused the electric heater to boil water. After sending a text message to her parents who live in Suryapet, Nalgonda district, about it, she ended her life. After a complaint was lodged with the police, a case was registered under sections 306 and 498-A (subjecting married woman to cruelty) of the IPC and the trio were remanded. Relatives of Shanker staged a protest demanding action against the family members of Sushruta and asked for a fair probe into the incident. They said that Shanker felt humiliated after he was sent to prison, said an official.
