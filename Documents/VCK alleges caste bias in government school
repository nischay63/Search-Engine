It is unfortunate that instead of inculcating progressive thoughts among the students in students, they are practising regressive caste discrimination,” he said.He said that caste discrimination has been continuing in the school for some time. Despite complaints the authorities have failed to take action against the headmistress and the teacher.R. Balamurali, Chief Education Officer of Cuddalore district said that a teacher had behaved in a high handed manner with students. There was difference of opinion between teachers and this has divided the students as well. “We are conducting an inquiry on and we will submit a report to the Collector within two days,” he said.
