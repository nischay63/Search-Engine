Mumbai: Taking suo moto cognisance of news reports that over 600 children had died of malnutrition in Palghar district in 2016, the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) on Thursday issued a notice to the Maharashtra government, seeking a report within four weeks. “Such a large number of deaths in a year amounts to violations of right to life and health.” The notice said the reports indicated that Palghar has significant tribal population affected by poverty, illiteracy, and lack of awareness towards government welfare and health care schemes. The notice has been sent to Chief Secretary Swadheen Kshatriya to provide information about the situation in worst-affected tehsils like Mokhada, Jawhar, Wada and Vikramgadh.“A tribal woman lost her two-year-old child in August. Angry residents of Khoch village confronted the State Tribal Welfare Minister, who said that the government is doing its work and the schemes are being implemented. Locals have alleged that funds are being allocated, but not reaching the beneficiaries,” the commission said. The notice comes a day after the State Health Minister, Tribal Development Minister, and the Women and Child Development Minister visited Kalamwadi and Khoch villages in Mokhada tehsil to console the families of malnutrition victims. Anticipating protests by Shramjeevi Sanghatana activists, the district administration had initially clamped prohibitory orders in the villages, but withdrew them later. Over 200 policemen were deployed to avert any untoward incident.Meanwhile, a two-year-old child Rahul Wadkar became the latest victim on Wednesday at a hospital in Nashik.
