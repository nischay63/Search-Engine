 Two poachers, alleged to have been involved in the killing and illegal smuggling of one-horned rhinoceros parts from the Kaziranga National Park, were arrested by a team of Forest Department officials from Assam in Coonoor. They were assisted by personnel from the Tamil Nadu forest department.The two poachers, A Mohammed Maqbal Ali, 24, and M Mohammed Noor Qasim, 33, alleged to be illegal Bangladeshi immigrants residing in Assam, were hiding out in Coonoor. A joint-operation conducted by the Assam and Tamil Nadu Forest departments finally managed to trace the two suspects after a three-day operation. K Periyasamy, the Forest Range Officer, Coonoor Range, and Saravana Kumar, Forest Ranger, Nilgiris North Division, assisted the team from Assam during the operations.Sources told The Hindu that the two men had initially fled to Kerala, and sensing that they were being tracked, had then crossed the border into Tamil Nadu and had taken refuge in farms and tea estates in Coonoor. District Forest Officer (Nilgiris North Division), S Kalanithi, said that they were looking into whether the two men had poached animals in Tamil Nadu, specifically The Nilgiris. “We will check whether they were actively involved in poaching or had links with other poachers here,” he said.The two men were arrested and produced before a judge in Coonoor. A forest department official said that after obtaining a transit warrant, the two men would be taken to Assam, where they would be charged under various sections of the Wildlife Protection Act. The horn of the Indian rhinoceros, which is otherwise known as the one-horned rhinoceros, is in great demand in South East Asia, where it is falsely claimed to be an aphrodisiac.
