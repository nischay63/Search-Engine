 Stepping in to mediate the crisis in the Samajwadi Party, senior SP leader and Raya Sabha MP, Ramgopal Yadav, who is Party leader Mulayam Singh’s cousin, on Thursday came out in support of Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav.Mr Ramgopal Yadav said the party leadership had committed a “mistake,” though not a deliberate one, in sacking his nephew from the post of State president, blaming the current fiasco on misunderstandings” and assured it would end in a day or two.The day’s developments, however, further brought to fore the divisions within the family on the role of Mr Mulayam Singh’s friend Amar Singh. While Mr. Ramgopal Yadav strongly hinted that Mr Amar Singh, with whom he shares a troubled relationship, had fuelled the present crisis in a bid to “damage the party,” newly appointed SP State president Shivpal Yadav, defended Mr Mulayam Singh’s recent decision to welcome Amar Singh back into the party after six years. Mr. Shivpal said it was “necessary to take everybody along to strengthen the party” and that one should not get swayed by outsiders.On Wednesday, in a veiled reference to Mr Amar Singh, Mr Akhilesh Yadav blamed “outsiders” for disrupting the functioning of the government.
