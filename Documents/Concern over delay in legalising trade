 The Transport Department is yet to take steps to legalise the two-wheeler rental business even though a large number of entrepreneurs have been in the trade for a long time.The two-wheeler rental business, has of late become largely unorganised with several operating vehicles without proper permit.The business, which was originally centred on Mission Street and adjoining areas, has now spread to other parts of the town with even hotel employees, autorickshaw drivers and traders providing the service to tourists, mostly during weekends.Those involved in the business for decades had formed a registered association - Pondicherry Two Wheeler Rental Owners Association - and for long been demanding the trade be streamlined.“The government had eight years ago announced to legalise the business. But nothing has happened so far,” said a person involved in the rental business on Mission Street. Even though applications were issued for permits, it never progressed after that, said a member of the association.“Applications issued by the State Transport Authority wanted those in the business to fulfil conditions including production of a non-conviction certificate, licence for transaction in foreign exchange and solvency certificate. They were also required to have a 24-hour telephone service, necessary facility for parking, maintenance, sanitation, reception and provide ISI marked helmets for the driver and pillion rider,” he said.Lack of clarity on the government’s part was the main reason for the present plight, said another member. “Now, because of pressure from several quarters, the department has stopped giving licence even to those willing to fulfil all obligations. We are ready to pay a fee fixed by the government to obtain the licence. Its revenue to the government. In several States, two-wheeler rental has become a legal business,” he said. There are more than 1,000 two-wheelers in the city available for rent, said a member, stressing the need to legalise the business as they form an important link to the tourism industry.
