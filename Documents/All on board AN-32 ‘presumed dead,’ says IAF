 As search continues for the missing AN-32 transport aircraft, the Indian Air Force has informed the families of the 29 personnel onboard that their kin are “presumed dead.”“This is an administrative procedure required to be done to clear compensation for the next of kin. The search will continue,” a senior IAF officer said on Thursday. In a letter to the families dated August 24, 2016, the IAF said, “The Court of Inquiry, upon careful scrutiny of the circumstantial evidence available, has concluded that it is unlikely that the missing personnel on board the ill-fated aircraft would have survived the accident.”
