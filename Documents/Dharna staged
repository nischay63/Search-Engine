Members belonging to 10 Sri Lankan refugee families living in Kalaignar Colony near here staged a dharna on the Collectorate premises on Sunday after the pattas of their lands were reportedly cancelled recently. After Palayamkottai Tahsildar Balasubramanian met the families and assured them that the issue would be taken up with the Collector, the protestors gave up the agitation.
