Mr. Kerry said the two countries can also work on climate change, health and energy.Recalling the assassination of the country’s founding father Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and most of his family members in 1975, Ms. Hasina requested Mr. Kerry to extradite Mujib’s convicted killers living in the U.S.Mr. Kerry said: “The issue [of extradition] is under review by the U.S. government.”Later speaking at a select gathering in Dhaka, Mr. Kerry underscored the need for “more frequent” communication with Bangladesh for fighting terrorism and militancy.
