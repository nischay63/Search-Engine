Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday appealed for calm in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu after violence erupted over the Cauvery water release, saying that he was “personally pained at the developments”.“Violence cannot provide a solution to any problem. In a democracy, solutions are found through restraint and mutual dialogue. This dispute can only be solved within the legal ambit. Breaking the law is not a viable alternative...it is only causing loss to the poor, and to our nation’s property,” he said in a statement.‘Uphold national interest’Mr. Modi asked the people of Karnataka and Tamil Nadu to act with sensitivity.“Whenever the country has faced adverse circumstances, the people of Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, just like people across the country, have always handled the situation with sensitivity. I appeal to the people of the two States, to display sensitivity, and also keep in mind their civic responsibilities,” Mr. Modi said in a statement.“I trust you will keep national interest and nation building above all else, and give priority to restraint, harmony, and to finding a solution, eschewing violence, destruction and arson,” he said.
