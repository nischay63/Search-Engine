Bidar: Bidar police arrested a city based dance teacher who they are saying killed two of his friends over a petty fight two days ago. Sachin Dayanand Kamble, 28, killed Sumit Devdas and Shivakumar Sharanappa and tried to set Sumit’s house on fire, SP Prakash Nikam told presspersons in Bidar on Saturday. Sumit had invited his four friends for a liquor party at his house on September 13. Ramesh and Prashant left after a few drinks at around 10 at night. Sachin, Sumit and Shivakumar stayed behind and drank more. They fought over a trivial issue early in the morning. Sachin lost his cool and hit Sumit with a stick. When Shivakumar tried to reason with Sachin, he hit him too. Sachin later switched on the gas stove and set fire to the house before leaving and make it look like a cylinder blast. In a few minutes however, an early rising neighbour noticed the fumes and called the fire and emergency services personnel. This averted a major fire disaster. Sachin told the police that he used to watch a lot of Police procedural dramas and crime serials on TV, that gave him clues about destroying evidence, the SP said. He gave an award to the team that solved the case, including circle inspector Sharanabasappa B, and sub inspector Santosh B. L. Eom
