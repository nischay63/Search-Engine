: Holding the State government responsible for the attack on Perarivalan, one of the convicts in the Rajiv Gandhi assassination case lodged in Vellore prison, DMK leader M. Karunanidhi said the government should release him and others immediately by invoking Article 161 of the Constitution.In a statement here, he said there was no need for the State government to rely on 435 of the CrPc which had mandated the State government to act after consultation with the Central government in certain cases.“The attack on Perarivalan has thoroughly exposed the State government’s failure to maintain law and order. How could a convict lodged in prison could get an iron rod and attack another convict,” he said.Mr. Karunanidhi said even though the State Assembly had adopted a resolution seeking the release of Perarivalan and others in February 2014, the imperious tone of the Chief Minister forced the Centre to file a petition against their release in the Supreme Court. “She did not come forward to write to the Centre requesting their release. Instead, a letter was sent by the then Chief Secretary Gnanadesikan. The State government is fully responsible for the present state of affairs,” he alleged.Support for bandhMr. Karunanidhi said his party would support the bandh called by farmers’ association in support of Tamil Nadu’s right over Cauvery water and to condemn the violence against the Tamils in Karnakata on September 16.
