Pressure is growing on the district administration and the State government to tackle the menacing roads blocks on the Kozhikode Mini Bypass in the city.Like several other organisations, the Malabar Chamber of Commerce has urged Minister for Public Works G. Sudhakaran to widen the stretch between Kalluthankadavu and Meenchanda, which experiences traffic congestion even during off-peak hours.MCC president C. Mohan said the mini bypass had been envisaged in 1980 to ease the traffic jam on the Kallai- Panniyankara- Kannancherry- Meenchanda route. However, the width of the road had been reduced from its original plan following demands then. The flow of vehicles to the mini bypass would double after the completion of the renovation of the Stadium- Puthiyara Road, Francis Road and Puthiyapalam Road. So the only option to accommodate this heavy volume is to widen the mini bypass, he said.Motorists go through a harrowing experience at the Comtrust Junction, Mankavu Junction and the MIMS Junction. The traffic blocks would increase with the commencement of the MES hospital, annexes of the Comtrust Eye Hospital and several other commercial establishments.The widening of the road between Eranhipalam and Kalluthankadavu is being done now. So it would be possible to acquire land between Kalluthankadavu and Meenchanda for widening purpose. The commercial establishments have come up after leaving space for road widening, Mr. Mohan said.Nod for NH wideningMeanwhile, the PWD has approved the widening by 24 metres of the Mananchira- Pavangad stretch of the Kozhikode- Kannur National Highway. The funds would be sourced from the Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board.The approval was based on the talks held by Mr. Sudhakaran, Mayor Thottathil Raveendran and Kozhikode North MLA, A. Pradeeepkumar. The project has been in cold storage for a long time.
