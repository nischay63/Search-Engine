The National Investigation Agency (NIA) is all set to take over the probe into the Uri incident, where 18 Army personnel were killed in an attack on an Army camp by four Jaish-e-Mohammad terrorists .The NIA would collect DNA samples of the terrorists and look at the commonalities in the Uri and the Pathankot air base attacks in January.The decision to hand over the case to the NIA comes even as the agency received no reply from the Pakistani authorities on the letter rogatory (judicial request for evidence) it had sent on the Pathankot attack.A senior NIA official said that as many as nine letter rogatorys are pending with Pakistan.“In the past two-three years, there have been nine instances when we have sent letter rogatorys to Pakistan seeking evidence to aid our case. There is irrefutable evidence of local Pakistani help in all these cases. We need to connect dots but Pakistan refuses to part with any information,” said the NIA official.In March last, India invited a Joint Investigation Team from Pakistan comprising an Inter State Services (ISI) official to probe the Pathankot attack.
