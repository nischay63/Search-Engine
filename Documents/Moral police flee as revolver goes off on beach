 An evening outing to Cherayi, a popular beach located 30 kilometres away from Kochi city, on Onam day turned out to be a nightmare for a five-member family from Kothamangalam when they were attacked by two local residents.According to the police, the attack took place some two kilometres north of the main beach around 7 p.m. The eldest member of the family was changing his clothes after bathing in the sea when two persons launched a verbal attack on him for ‘public obscenity’.The tension, however, escalated into a fist fight as the family resisted the attack. Then came the unexpected twist - a revolver goes off and the moral cops flee the spot. The family then approached the Munambam police, which registered a case of assault against the accused, who were later identified.A preliminary investigation revealed that the complainant had obtained licence to use the revolver, which went off accidentally during the clash. “A statement by the complainant said the revolver had been kept inside a pocket of his trousers and it fell down on the beach during the clash. When they tried to get hold of the weapon, it went off accidentally and luckily nobody was injured,” said Arun CR, Circle Inspector, Munnambam.
