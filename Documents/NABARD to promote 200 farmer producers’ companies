It would extend financial assistance to meet the initial expenses of each FPO, said S. Nagoor Ali Jinnah, Chief General Manager, NABARD.Talking to The Hindu here on Thursday, he said the NABARD will lend term loan or composite loan with working capital and term loan requirement to FPOs.It will fund for skill building exercises, guide business planning and support technological extension through exposure visits, agriculture university tie-ups, expert meetings and explore tie-up with buyers and big agro companies.Equity support was restricted to Rs.1,000 per borrower for 1,000 borrowers. The FPO can get loan up to Rs.1 crore.The FPO will help farmers to increase income, scale down production cost, eliminate middle men and empower them with bargaining power.Top priority was given to improve irrigation facilities as the state had tapped 85 per cent of groundwater.
