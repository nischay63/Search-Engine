The capacity of the plant is 16,000 tonne per year.The injured workers -- Nageswara Rao and Babulu – were admitted to a private hospital in Bhimavaram.Residents of Tundurru and its surrounding villages have been opposing the project alleging that the aqua food park would cause pollution and contaminate water.
