: A tense situation prevailed at the Visakhapatnam International Airport here on Sunday evening as leaders and activists of Opposition parties gathered in large numbers to gherao Visakhapatnam MP and BJP State president K. Haribabu on the railway zone issue.The bid to mob Mr. Haribabu was foiled by the police, who took the Opposition leaders into custody even before the arrival of the MP.The Visakhapatnam MP had been making categorical statements on and off that the BJP favoured Visakhapatnam as headquarters for the proposed railway zone. The statements that the Centre was considering Vijayawada as headquarters of the new zone aroused suspicions among leaders of North Andhra that the BJP and the TDP were trying to deceive the people.They demanded the resignation of Dr. Haribabu for his failure to protect the interests of Vizag. Railway Zone Sadhana Samithi convener J.V. Satyanarayana Murthy and CPI leader Stalin, and YSRC district president Gudivada Amarnath were taken into custody and taken away by the police.Meanwhile, BJP leaders M. Nagendra, P.V.N. Madhav and others raised slogans in support of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and against those ‘who were are opposing development of AP’ as they awaited the arrival of the MP at the exit gate. They formed a chain around Dr. Haribabu as he stepped out of the terminal building and raised slogans in his support. Meanwhile, two women leaders of the Left parties emerged from the crowd and tried to squat in front of the MP’s car. They offered stiff resistance as the police tried to whisk them away. The police dragged them aside and the MP’s car moved ahead. The women expressed their ire on the police vehicle, which was supposed to follow the MP, and stopped it. Once again, a policeman had to pull them aside.
