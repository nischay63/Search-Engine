With the water level in the Godavari crossing 31 feet at Bhadrachalam on Wednesday evening, the Police, Irrigation and Fire Services Departments initiated additional measures on the banks of the river in the temple town to facilitate safe immersion of Ganeshas. More than 160 Ganeshas were immersed in the Godavari at the temple town till 6 p.m. on Wednesday. Three cranes were pressed into service to facilitate hassle-free immersion of large Ganeshas. Additional swimmers were deployed on the Karakatta (flood protection bank) and the bathing ghats along the river banks as a precautionary measure. The water level in the river is expected to rise by another one or two feet by Thursday morning. However, it is likely to remain much below the first warning level of 43 feet, sources added. Meanwhile, heavy rain battered Khammam town on Wednesday night leaving several low-lying areas in the town waterlogged.
