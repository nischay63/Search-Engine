The Turkish Muslim cleric accused by Turkey of plotting a failed coup two months ago denounced the repression of his supporters on Thursday, calling the crackdown “dark pages in world history.”The cleric, Fethullah Gulen, who lives in self-imposed exile in the Pocono Mountains of Pennsylvania, said the arrests, purges and dismissals undertaken by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey, a former ally, reflected the behaviour of a man seeking to “acquire sovereignty unconditionally for himself”.Mr. Gulen accused the government of subjecting his followers to “oppression and tyranny”.Mr. Erdogan and his subordinates have blamed Mr. Gulen for the coup attempt, which left at least 271 people dead. Mr. Gulen (75), who has repeatedly denied involvement in the coup attempt, made his remarks in Turkish in a recorded video address to the World Affairs Council of Philadelphia, which streamed the address and provided a simultaneous translation.It was Mr. Gulen’s first public comment about the coup attempt and its aftermath since Turkey, a U.S. ally, formally requested that U.S. authorities arrest him while Turkish prosecutors seek to have him extradited. Turkey’s semi-official Anadolu news agency said on Tuesday that the Justice Ministry had demanded his arrest on charges of “ordering and commanding the attempted coup”.Mr. Gulen did not address the extradition issue. But his principal deputy, Y. Alp Aslandogan, who spoke to the World Affairs Council after the video was shown, said Mr. Gulen had no plans to leave the United States. — New York Times News Service
