On the other side was a blood donation camp in progress. People, especially youngsters, voluntarily walked in to donate blood.The size of the crowd though was not very big as only people who could fit into the frontage attached to the food courts were allowed inside, but that did not diminish their boisterous streak.A free film show followed by lunch and the blood donation camp was organised as part of the birthday celebrations of CEO and Managing Director of ‘Y’ Screens Y. Ratna Kumar and the guest on the occasion was upcoming actor M. Naga Shourya.All eyes were on the main door and the crowd went bonkers as the actor stepped inside. Many of the young boys blew loud whistles to give expression to their excitement. For the SKCV children, it was a rare opportunity of seeing an actor from close quarters.

Addressing media persons, he said he was happy to be part of this joyful gathering and complimented Mr. Ratna Kumar for his endeavour.
