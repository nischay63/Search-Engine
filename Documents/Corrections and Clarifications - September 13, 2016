In Coimbatore, the Indian Air Force’s Air Force Administrative College (a training institution) was bestowed the President’s Colours in 2000 by K.R. Narayanan. A Tri-Service training institution, National Defence Academy, Pune, was awarded the President’s Colours in 1978 by Neelam Sanjiva Reddy.>>Editing error: Throughout the text of the report, “ >Mariyappan wins high jump gold” (Sport, Sept. 11, 2016), Mariyappan’s name had been misspelt.
