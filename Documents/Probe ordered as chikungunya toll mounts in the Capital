Delhi Health Minister Satyendar Jain announced a probe into the chikungunya-related deaths, pointing out that no deaths have taken place at hospitals under the Delhi government. The sudden outbreak also prompted the Delhi government to cancel leave of all doctors, nurses and paramedic staff at its hospitals and dispensaries on Wednesday to ensure the patients don't face an inconvenience.
