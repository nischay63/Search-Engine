Abandoned buildings and unused quarters belonging to the Ministry of Defence have turned into a breeding ground for mosquitoes in Avadi where 23 cases were reported last year.Identifying nearly 50 such dilapidated structures within its limits, Avadi Municipality has joined hands with the defence organisations to eliminate mosquito breeding at the source itself.“As part of our drive against dengue and other viral diseases, we are roping in the Ministry of Defence as all the three wings have their units here (Avadi),” C. Mathevannan, Municpal Commissioner told The Hindu .The municipality has asked the defence establishments to allow health inspectors and support staff to disinfect their premises including the abandoned and unused buildings, he said. Otherwise, the respective military establishments have to clean their premises or demolish such structures by mid-September. If the defence organisations do not comply with the order, the municipality would impose a fine, he cautioned.At present, the local body has completed disinfection procedures only on the premises of CVR&DE (Combat Vehicles Research & Development Establishment). Rest of the defence establishments including Heavy Vehicles Factory (HVF), Ordnance Depot, Ordnance Clothing Factory (OCF) and Indian Air Force (IAF) are yet to be covered.Of the total 65 sq.km of municipal limits, defence establishments cover 21 sq.km where vast tracts of land are covered with thick vegetation. Unlike other areas, municipal officials said, defence establishments have restricted access making it difficult for sanitary and health officials to inspect these premises regularly. Now, every Saturday, over 200 domestic breeding checkers (DBC) of the municipality clean select defence organisations after obtaining prior permission.Helplines launchedWith dengue taking its toll in Tiruvallur district, three helpline numbers have been created by Avadi municipality for residents for information on dengue and other viral fevers (044-26554440, 9941505469 and 8220091122).Municipal officials said residents can give information of any sick patients in their houses or about abandoned buildings and water stagnation which could act as mosquito breeding centres.They can also report about DBC workers not inspecting their houses. The municipality has also created a WhatsApp group connecting heads of all 68 schools to inform them of sick students.
